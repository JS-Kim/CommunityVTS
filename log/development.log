In 2012 the Mariners finished fifth in the East division of the Appalachian League with a 29-38 record but hope to bounce back in 2013 with a solid core of new players taking the field.</p><p>Of the 19 pitchers named to the 33-man roster only one pitcher was a member of the 2012 squad.</p><p>The lone pitcher returning from last season is Wander Marte a lefty from Santo Domingo Dominican Republic. The 6’2 starter compiled a 1-6 record and had an ERA of 4.94 in 31 innings pitched. Marte will be joined by 18 other pitchers.</p><p>Here’s a rundown of the 2013 staff.</p><p>Lefties:</p><p>Eddie Campbell was taken in the 15th round of the 2013 draft and won’t have to travel far to begin his professional baseball career – his collegiate career was spent right up the road in Blacksburg at Virginia Tech. This past spring the lefty made sixteen appearances five of which were starts. He finished his junior year with a 2-5 record and a 5.40 ERA despite holding opponents to a .240 clip at the plate.</p><p>Luiz Gohara comes to Pulaski at the young age of sixteen years old signing as an undrafted free agent last year. Despite his youth the 6’3 prospect from Tupa Brazil consistently hits the low to mid 90′s with his fastball. He is considered one of the more promising prospects throughout the entire Seattle Mariners farm system. Keep an eye on him.</p><p>Will Mathis is a 22-year-old graduate from the University of New Mexico who the Mariners selected in the 25th round of the 2013 MLB Draft. Mathis made 22 appearances from the Lobos bullpen working 20 1/3 innings in relief. Mathis was a teammate of Lobos third baseman D.J. Peterson who the Mariners selected in the first round at 12th overall.</p><p>Leoncio Munoz has been in the Mariners system since the age of 19 having played his first three years of professional ball in the Dominican Summer League. Every year his numbers get better – in 2010 he was 2-1 with a 3.82 ERA in 2011 he was 3-0 with a 3.67 ERA and 2012 was his best yet as he went 6-2 with an impressive 2.01 ERA. Those dominant numbers earned Munoz a well-deserved promotion in 2013.</p><p>Luis Pina enters his third season of professional baseball having spent his first year in the Venezuelan Summer League and last year in the Arizona League. Pina was predominantly a starter in his first two years having started 17 games in his 20 total appearances. He threw just fifteen innings last summer.</p><p>Scott Ronnenbergh is a 21-year-old that hails from Amsterdam Netherlands. Ronnenbergh begins his fourth season in the Mariners farm system after spending the first three years in the Arizona League. He made all of his fourteen appearances out of the pen last season.</p><p>Jake Zokan is the eighth lefty on the Pulaski Mariners pitching staff. Zokan was drafted in the 9th round of the 2013 MLB Draft out of College of Charleston in South Carolina. Zokan was the ace for the Cougars and finished his senior campaign with a 4-3 record and a 2.85 ERA in 79 innings pitched. He started fourteen games and had an impressive K/BB ratio of 5.33/1.</p><p> </p><p>Righties:</p><p>Ramire Cleto looks to crack the Mariners starting rotation after an impressive second season in the Dominican Summer League. Cleto finished with a 6-4 record and a 2.33 ERA despite striking out just 26 batters in 69 2/3 innings of work.</p><p>Cameron Copping comes in as one of the power arms of the Mariners staff. Although Copping was undrafted in 2012 his frame (6’6 220 pounds) is intriguing. Copping made fifteen bullpen appearances last year in the Arizona League going 0-1 with a 5.94 ERA. However he did strike out 22 batters in 16 2/3 innings.</p><p>Noel De La Cruz looks to be a potential workhorse for the Mariners in 2013. De La Cruz completely dominated in the Dominican Summer League last year going 8-2 with a 1.92 ERA in 13 starts. He allowed just 68 hits in 79 2/3 innings pitched.</p><p>Dylan De Meyer enters his second year in the Mariners organization having signed as a non-drafted free agent in 2011. He spent his first year in the Arizona League and made twelve appearances nine of them starts.</p><p>Edwin Diaz was selected in the 3rd round of the 2012 MLB Draft out of Puerto Rico. A highly-touted prospect Diaz struggled during his first professional season in the Arizona League. Diaz made nine appearances (one start) and held an ERA of 5.21. Command issues plagued the 19-year-old – in 19 innings he struck out 20 walked 17 and hit five batters.</p><p>Jose Flores begins his fourth season in the Mariners farm system and at the age of 20 is ready to turn the corner. Flores pitched well in the Venezuelan Summer League his first two professional seasons but struggled last year in the Arizona League. Flores had a WHIP of 1.07 in 2011 but saw that jump to 1.62 in 2012. Let’s hope he finds his 2011 form.</p><p>Emilio Pagan was drafted in the 10th round of the 2013 MLB Draft out of Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina. Pagan was the Crusaders everyday third baseman and was also tabbed as the closer. As a junior Pagan converted 13 saves in 13 chances and didn’t allow a single run all season. Those dominant numbers earned the Simpsonville South Carolina superstar second-team All-American honors.</p><p>The Seattle Mariners found a gem in the 30th round of the 2013 MLB Draft selecting right-hander Rafael Pineda from Texas A&amp;M. Pineda finished his junior season on a high note with the Aggies posting a 6-5 record and a 3.23 ERA in the ever-so-tough Southeastern Conference. The 6’6 210 pound prospect was equally as impressive his sophomore season as he was 5-1 with a 2.71 ERA in 83 innings of work.</p><p>Gabe Saquilon begins his third year in the Mariners organization and first at the advanced-rookie level. The Mariners selected Saquilon in the 25th round of the 2011 MLB Draft. Saquilon spent his first two professional seasons in the Arizona League with mild success going 3-4 with a 4.48 ERA in 21 appearances (eight starts).</p><p>In the 18th round of the 2013 MLB Draft the Seattle Mariners selected 6’3 right-hander Troy Scott of Riverside Community College in California. Scott was used strictly as a reliever this past season and put up some gaudy numbers going 1-0 with a 1.93 ERA in 14 innings. It’ll be interesting to see if those JUCO numbers translate to the professional level.</p><p>Daniel Thieben a 6’4 righty from Buchholz in der Nordheid Germany spent his first professional season in the Arizona League. Thieben managed a 3-1 record paired with a 4.02 ERA in 15 appearances (one start). Opponents hit .308 against the German product and command issues also seemed to be Thieben’s weakness. In 31 1/3 innings he struck out 18 but walked a whopping 21 batters. Those numbers will have to improve as Thieben makes the jump to the Appalachian League.</p><p>The season is set to get underway Thursday against the Burlington Royals the defending Appalachian League East champions. Probable starters can be seen below.</p><p>Thursday: Edwin Diaz</p><p>Friday: Luiz Gohara</p><p>Saturday: Noel De La Cruz</p> </div></div>' LIMIT 1

All teenagers and women lifted on Friday while the heavier men lifted both Saturday and Sunday. The meet was hosted in the Days Inn North in Knoxville.</p><p>Pulaski County High School rising ninth grader Cherokee Widner traveled the four hours Thursday morning and weighed in at 137 lbs. right before noon. On Friday morning after an 8am rules meeting Widner began competing in the 148 lb category for 13-15 year old males. The 14 year old set a personal best with a 237 lb. below parallel squat on his third and final attempt. Because of irritating hip pointers Cherokee performed his record squat with no lifting belt but his core strength proved ample enough to handle the weight. In the bench press contest he pushed 187.4 lbs with a two second pause for his second attempt. Widner actually benched 192.9 lbs in his third and final attempt but was not given credit for the lift due to locking it out unevenly by a mere margin. During the deadlift contest he picked up 303.1 lbs in his first lift missed a 330.7 lb second attempt and scratched his final attempt. Just wearing the supportive weigh belt caused pain so Cherokee and his dad/coach decided to call it a day for safety sake.</p><p>Widner traveled back to Virginia that afternoon with five large battle axes for winning the National Championships in the full powerlifting (727.5 lbs) push/pull (490.5 lbs) bench press (187.4lbs) deadlift (303.1 lbs) and squat (237 lbs). All of his final lifts finished in the top five in the SPF’s record book and established Virginia State records for the 13-15 year old/148 lb category.

All teenagers and women lifted on Friday while the heavier men lifted both Saturday and Sunday. The meet was hosted in the Days Inn North in Knoxville.</p><p>Pulaski County High School rising ninth grader Cherokee Widner traveled the four hours Thursday morning and weighed in at 137 lbs. right before noon. On Friday morning after an 8am rules meeting Widner began competing in the 148 lb category for 13-15 year old males. The 14 year old set a personal best with a 237 lb. below parallel squat on his third and final attempt. Because of irritating hip pointers Cherokee performed his record squat with no lifting belt but his core strength proved ample enough to handle the weight. In the bench press contest he pushed 187.4 lbs with a two second pause for his second attempt. Widner actually benched 192.9 lbs in his third and final attempt but was not given credit for the lift due to locking it out unevenly by a mere margin. During the deadlift contest he picked up 303.1 lbs in his first lift missed a 330.7 lb second attempt and scratched his final attempt. Just wearing the supportive weigh belt caused pain so Cherokee and his dad/coach decided to call it a day for safety sake.</p><p>Widner traveled back to Virginia that afternoon with five large battle axes for winning the National Championships in the full powerlifting (727.5 lbs) push/pull (490.5 lbs) bench press (187.4lbs) deadlift (303.1 lbs) and squat (237 lbs). All of his final lifts finished in the top five in the SPF’s record book and established Virginia State records for the 13-15 year old/148 lb category. Cherokee and his family are pleased with the results of the meet and are excited that he has 1 ½ years and 11 more pounds of muscle to gain before he leaves this particular category. Up next on his powerlifting quest is the American Powerlifting Association World Powerlifting Championships in Defuniak Springs Florida in late July.</p>   </div></div>"], ["external_popularity", 0], ["fb_comments_count", 0], ["fb_id", nil], ["fb_likes_count", 0], ["fb_link", nil], ["fb_type", nil], ["image_content_type", nil], ["image_file_name", nil], ["image_file_size", nil], ["image_updated_at", nil], ["image_url", nil], ["kind", 2], ["latitude", 38.1915583], ["longitude", -81.00028689999999], ["popularity", 0], ["published_at", Thu, 20 Jun 2013 14:08:31 UTC +00:00], ["related_story_id", nil], ["source", "The Southwest Times"], ["source_url", "http://www.southwesttimes.com/2013/06/widner-earns-five-national-powerlifting-titles/"], ["title", "Widner Earns Five National Powerlifting Titles"], ["topic_id", 4], ["tweets_count", 0], ["twitter_id", nil], ["twitter_retweet_count", 0], ["updated_at", Tue, 25 Jun 2013 20:38:54 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["user_id", nil], ["views", 0]]

Anyone receiving a call from a company who claims to be collecting on an unpaid Payday Cash Advance loan should be weary of the call she said “because it’s probably a scam.”</p><p>Jennings said the callers perpetuating the scam claim they represent a collection agency working on behalf of the loan company.

After almost an hour and some negotiation of line items the budget finally passed.</p><p>Under the finance agenda was a vote on adopting a slight increase in fixed fees for water service another on adopting the capital improvement plan and the final item was a vote on adopting the budget for the 2013-2014 fiscal year.</p><p>At the June 4 meeting council passed a motion to direct staff to prepare paperwork to increase the fixed costs of water service in town by 15 percent. The fixed water fee increase would raise most residential water bills by about $1.31 monthly. The additional funds provided by the fee would help offset the cost of an inundation study that is part of the operation and management certification process for Gatewood Dam.</p><p>As on June 4 the motion passed after Mayor Jeff Worrell broke a tie by voting in favor of adopting the increased fees with Councilwoman Heather Steele Councilmen Greg East and Jamie Radcliffe voting against and Councilmen Dave Clark H.M. Kidd and Vice Mayor Joseph Goodman voting “yes” for the motion.</p><p>The motion to adopt the capital improvement plan for 2013-2014 went through a similar process as Steele East and Radcliffe voted against and Clark Kidd and Goodman voted for with Worrell’s vote for adopting the plan as the deciding tiebreaker.</p><p>This was also a repeat of the June 4 meeting when a motion to direct staff to prepare the paperwork to adopt the capital improvement plan split the council in half with the same three members voting against the motion and the rest of council including the mayor voting “yes.”</p><p>Before the vote to adopt the capital improvement plan East said “The only issue that I have with this was the $5000 for the awnings or what have you for the vehicle [Lady Rebecca the town trolley housed in an alley but with no covering from the elements]. I thought that that money could be better spent and actually I think we’re looking at other options for the vehicle housing the vehicle to protect it. I just wanted to make that comment Mr. Mayor thank you.”</p><p>Goodman said “If I may Mr. Mayor what I would remind council is that at any point we can make a change to this. We are required by law to adopt the capital improvement plan. If in July we determine there’s any change we’d like to make we can simply pass a motion to modify the existing capital improvement plan. I don’t know if we need a public hearing for it or not but we can always modify this stuff. It’s not set in stone. I just wanted to relay that. But we are required to pass this.”</p><p>After the capital improvement plan was adopted council turned to the budget the final item on the finance portion of the meeting’s agenda.</p><p>“As this council is very much aware we have been working on this budget since I believe July 17 of last year” said Worrell. “And we have had much debate. There had been a lot of hard work that’s gone into this year’s budget I’m certain none of us are 100 percent satisfied with it; there are certainly things that we wish were in there that are not in there.”</p><p>He continued “But it is a compromise and that’s the way it should work. And I am pleased with the proposed budget that we have hammered out and I would urge council to adopt it.”</p><p>Clark made a motion to adopt the budget as written seconded by Kidd. Worrell asked if there was any discussion but none was forthcoming. The vote was Steele East and Radcliffe against and Clark Kidd and Goodman voting for adopting the budget.</p><p>When the mayor was called upon to break the tie council was informed by Town Attorney David Warburton that the mayor was not allowed to vote. “It has to pass by majority of the council” said Warburton “and for this purpose the mayor is not a member of the council. You’ve got to have four votes for it or three to two but I believe at this point the mayor does not cast a deciding vote on the budget.”</p><p>Warburton continued “Now I will tell you you have to have a budget by June 30. So you decide how you want to do it and I guess I can see [retiring Finance Director] Sherry Boyd’s last days here as being rather memorable but you need a budget by June 30 2013.”</p><p>Goodman asked if making changes to the budget would require another two-week advertising period.</p><p>“I think so” replied Warburton. “You have to allow the public to have some input if they choose to. If you’re going to have a different budget you’re going to have to allow the public a chance to look at the different budget.”</p><p>Goodman observed that there aren’t 14 days left in the month in which to advertise.</p><p>“Lady and gentlemen you do what you wish but you’ve got to have a budget as close to June 30 as you can” advised Warburton “because otherwise you can’t spend any money. Which is fine but the employees aren’t going to like it. Contracts have to be honored etc.”</p><p>Kidd asked “How much money are you talking about?”</p><p>“The entire budget” said Warburton. Clark asked for clarification.</p><p>“You gotta pay your contracts you gotta pay your purchased services” said Warburton “but among other people council won’t get paid I won’t get paid–I don’t know the answer regarding your full-time employees but I think you’re gonna have a budget before you can pay them…or the consequence is we don’t have one we can’t do anything other than honor our current contracts.”</p><p>Clark asked “What does that do to services?”</p><p>“Well you have people like me who believe in giving back to their town” said Warburton. “I’ll work without a contract without getting paid for a little while. But I don’t know that I speak for everybody.”</p><p>“Would you say that we face a potential shutdown in government in post-government services?” asked Goodman.</p><p>“I will not say that” advised Warburton. “I will let you say that but I will not say that. I understand what you’re saying I know where you’re going with it but I will not say that.” He added that income would still come in from the state but would not be able to be spent.</p><p>Goodman advised the council to try to work out an agreeable budget immediately.</p><p>“Oh I don’t think you have any choice but to do that” said Worrell.</p><p>“My preference as the town’s attorney is that you have a budget tonight if at all possible” said Warburton.</p><p>Worrell advised that the council review the budget and discuss whichever portions of it they took issue with.</p><p>East said “I think we had some opportunities that were missed.” He mentioned the increase in water fees which led to debate about the necessity of raising them. He said the council had an eight-year history of raising fees to balance the budget and thought balancing was best done otherwise.</p><p>“What would you cut?” Worrell asked.</p><p>East mentioned merging some public jobs with others mentioning the Economic Developer’s position which was funded by an Urban Development Action Grant but now is paid out of the general fund.</p><p>Steele echoed East’s sentiments saying she did not want to raise fees to balance the budget.</p><p>The debate at various points became a running dialogue between East and Goodman.</p><p>East brought up The Ratcliffe museum’s part-time position funded by the budget saying the museum was originally intended to be manned only by volunteers. The budget called for about a $16000 total line item for paid museum employees.</p><p>East went on to say of trimming the budget “I think there are some [positions] where we could take advantage of streamlining and merging positions to the benefit of the budget and the benefit of the town” he said after saying “I feel we have a responsibility to be more efficient” and citing what he felt was the town’s “bloated government.”</p><p>He continued “Economic Development and this is no offense to Mr. White [Economic Developer John White present for the meeting] at all economic development is a but redundant. We have county economic development. You had suggested Mr. Goodman we go into maybe a community development-type position and merge a couple positions.”</p><p>He cited the position held by Barbi Tate acting as Community Relations Director and spoke of merging that with Economic Development a suggestion made earlier this year by Goodman.</p><p>After further discussion the possibility of merging positions was left behind for the time being when Worrell spoke up.</p><p>“It’s disappointing to me that we have gotten to this point and all the issues that ought to have been brought up be they the museum or the water fees” he said. “There were copies of this budget up four months ago and how we got to this stalemate—we’re doing things we railed at the federal government for doing and then we turned around and did exactly the same thing. I think the citizens deserve better leadership than they’re getting here this evening.”</p><p>He suggested that there was not enough information to make a decision about merging positions.</p><p>Warburton asked to weigh in saying “Frankly I didn’t see this one coming so you’ll have to be a little forgiving. I’ll have to walk back a little of what I said earlier.” He said that the town charter allows the council to amend the budget as long as no increases are made although decreases would be acceptable. He noted that it could also be adopted within the first six weeks of the fiscal year and would be retroactive.</p><p>He added “No monies can be expended for town purposes after the expiration of six weeks until after the budget shall have been adopted” apologizing for any misinformation previously.</p><p>Warburton also said he did not believe the budget would need to be readvertised as long as it did not go up.</p><p>“I’d rather see the budget pass tonight” said Goodman. “I think we’re doing a disservice to our citizens. I hate to try to bargain in public but I think that’s what we’re at now. The question I’d ask the three of you [Steele East and Radcliffe] is what would it take to pass this budget tonight?”</p><p>Goodman said that they could possibly cancel the increased rates in fixed water service fees but in order to pay for the dam study another $50000 would have to be located somewhere in the budget.</p><p>Town Manager John Hawley pointed out that the actual revenue generated by the fees would be $81000.</p><p>Goodman also offered the compromise of changing the water fees to a 12-month surcharge that would expire next year.</p><p>Clark addressed the council saying “For those of you who are up here besides the mayor I’ve been through more budgets than anyone. If I step on any toes I apologize to you up front. We’ve been hammering on this budget for 11 months. There’s not been a word said during this discussion that hasn’t been said during those 11 months. Everything that everyone’s disagreeing with was said ahead of time. No one up here came up with a way to fix it during those 11 months. No budget that we’ve had in this town in the eight years that I’ve been doing this has satisfied me. This one doesn’t either. But we have to continue our operations. And we have to work every year to try to do better at those operations. What we’re doing right now is not our job. Our job is to take care of the citizens of this town.” He pointed out that council could disagree indefinitely but this would not move things forward.</p><p>“I’m agreeing with you” said Kidd. “I think we’ve worked through it and…I think we’ve all made changes. But I think it’s a disservice if we can’t adopt this budget.”</p><p>Radcliffe pointed out that he thought funding for public vehicles was a more important use of the budget than part-time wages for the museum employees leading to further discussion of cutting back museum worker wages and bringing up again the possibility of merging the community relations and economic development positions.</p><p>“I just want to be clear that anything I’ve said here tonight wasn’t meant to be offensive to staff or anyone” said East. “I’m simply looking at a budget where we as council are obligated to give our citizens the best we can give them and I think we have an obligation to be as efficient as we can be.”</p><p>Goodman advised he wanted the same thing but that in terms of merging positions there might be an overload of work on persons holding what could amount to two jobs.</p><p>Despite this observation and after much further discussion council temporarily left the topic of the budget itself and voted to work with staff to develop a process beginning at July work session to discuss a merger of the economic development director community relations director and senior center director positions that is to be complete within 120 days.</p><p>Steele asked if council was reducing the museum employees’ funding by about $8000 was it possible to reallocate those funds for the Gatewood facility. Further discussion was pursued to determine what exact work would need to be done on it.</p><p>“Is this what council wants you want us to redo the showers redo the total bathhouse? We need some direction on what we do here” said Hawley. “We want to basically refit basically strip the structure and put everything new back in?”</p><p>“If we could just get a price get a plan of what we want to do we’d just be that much closer to actually pulling the trigger” said East.</p><p>After more debate council voted unanimously to adopt the 2013-2014 fiscal year budget with the reduction in part-time museum employees’ wages before going into a 10-minute recess.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p> </div></div>' LIMIT 1[0m

Kidd and Vice Mayor Joseph Goodman voting “yes” for the motion.</p><p>The motion to adopt the capital improvement plan for 2013-2014 went through a similar process as Steele East and Radcliffe voted against and Clark Kidd and Goodman voted for with Worrell’s vote for adopting the plan as the deciding tiebreaker.</p><p>This was also a repeat of the June 4 meeting when a motion to direct staff to prepare the paperwork to adopt the capital improvement plan split the council in half with the same three members voting against the motion and the rest of council including the mayor voting “yes.”</p><p>Before the vote to adopt the capital improvement plan East said “The only issue that I have with this was the $5000 for the awnings or what have you for the vehicle [Lady Rebecca the town trolley housed in an alley but with no covering from the elements]. I thought that that money could be better spent and actually I think we’re looking at other options for the vehicle housing the vehicle to protect it. I just wanted to make that comment Mr. Mayor thank you.”</p><p>Goodman said “If I may Mr. Mayor what I would remind council is that at any point we can make a change to this. We are required by law to adopt the capital improvement plan. If in July we determine there’s any change we’d like to make we can simply pass a motion to modify the existing capital improvement plan. I don’t know if we need a public hearing for it or not but we can always modify this stuff. It’s not set in stone. I just wanted to relay that. But we are required to pass this.”</p><p>After the capital improvement plan was adopted council turned to the budget the final item on the finance portion of the meeting’s agenda.</p><p>“As this council is very much aware we have been working on this budget since I believe July 17 of last year” said Worrell. “And we have had much debate. There had been a lot of hard work that’s gone into this year’s budget I’m certain none of us are 100 percent satisfied with it; there are certainly things that we wish were in there that are not in there.”</p><p>He continued “But it is a compromise and that’s the way it should work. And I am pleased with the proposed budget that we have hammered out and I would urge council to adopt it.”</p><p>Clark made a motion to adopt the budget as written seconded by Kidd. Worrell asked if there was any discussion but none was forthcoming. The vote was Steele East and Radcliffe against and Clark Kidd and Goodman voting for adopting the budget.</p><p>When the mayor was called upon to break the tie council was informed by Town Attorney David Warburton that the mayor was not allowed to vote. “It has to pass by majority of the council” said Warburton “and for this purpose the mayor is not a member of the council. You’ve got to have four votes for it or three to two but I believe at this point the mayor does not cast a deciding vote on the budget.”</p><p>Warburton continued “Now I will tell you you have to have a budget by June 30. So you decide how you want to do it and I guess I can see [retiring Finance Director] Sherry Boyd’s last days here as being rather memorable but you need a budget by June 30 2013.”</p><p>Goodman asked if making changes to the budget would require another two-week advertising period.</p><p>“I think so” replied Warburton. “You have to allow the public to have some input if they choose to. If you’re going to have a different budget you’re going to have to allow the public a chance to look at the different budget.”</p><p>Goodman observed that there aren’t 14 days left in the month in which to advertise.</p><p>“Lady and gentlemen you do what you wish but you’ve got to have a budget as close to June 30 as you can” advised Warburton “because otherwise you can’t spend any money. Which is fine but the employees aren’t going to like it. Contracts have to be honored etc.”</p><p>Kidd asked “How much money are you talking about?”</p><p>“The entire budget” said Warburton. Clark asked for clarification.</p><p>“You gotta pay your contracts you gotta pay your purchased services” said Warburton “but among other people council won’t get paid I won’t get paid–I don’t know the answer regarding your full-time employees but I think you’re gonna have a budget before you can pay them…or the consequence is we don’t have one we can’t do anything other than honor our current contracts.”</p><p>Clark asked “What does that do to services?”</p><p>“Well you have people like me who believe in giving back to their town” said Warburton. “I’ll work without a contract without getting paid for a little while. But I don’t know that I speak for everybody.”</p><p>“Would you say that we face a potential shutdown in government in post-government services?” asked Goodman.</p><p>“I will not say that” advised Warburton. “I will let you say that but I will not say that. I understand what you’re saying I know where you’re going with it but I will not say that.” He added that income would still come in from the state but would not be able to be spent.</p><p>Goodman advised the council to try to work out an agreeable budget immediately.</p><p>“Oh I don’t think you have any choice but to do that” said Worrell.</p><p>“My preference as the town’s attorney is that you have a budget tonight if at all possible” said Warburton.</p><p>Worrell advised that the council review the budget and discuss whichever portions of it they took issue with.</p><p>East said “I think we had some opportunities that were missed.” He mentioned the increase in water fees which led to debate about the necessity of raising them. He said the council had an eight-year history of raising fees to balance the budget and thought balancing was best done otherwise.</p><p>“What would you cut?” Worrell asked.</p><p>East mentioned merging some public jobs with others mentioning the Economic Developer’s position which was funded by an Urban Development Action Grant but now is paid out of the general fund.</p><p>Steele echoed East’s sentiments saying she did not want to raise fees to balance the budget.</p><p>The debate at various points became a running dialogue between East and Goodman.</p><p>East brought up The Ratcliffe museum’s part-time position funded by the budget saying the museum was originally intended to be manned only by volunteers. The budget called for about a $16000 total line item for paid museum employees.</p><p>East went on to say of trimming the budget “I think there are some [positions] where we could take advantage of streamlining and merging positions to the benefit of the budget and the benefit of the town” he said after saying “I feel we have a responsibility to be more efficient” and citing what he felt was the town’s “bloated government.”</p><p>He continued “Economic Development and this is no offense to Mr. White [Economic Developer John White present for the meeting] at all economic development is a but redundant. We have county economic development. You had suggested Mr. Goodman we go into maybe a community development-type position and merge a couple positions.”</p><p>He cited the position held by Barbi Tate acting as Community Relations Director and spoke of merging that with Economic Development a suggestion made earlier this year by Goodman.</p><p>After further discussion the possibility of merging positions was left behind for the time being when Worrell spoke up.</p><p>“It’s disappointing to me that we have gotten to this point and all the issues that ought to have been brought up be they the museum or the water fees” he said. “There were copies of this budget up four months ago and how we got to this stalemate—we’re doing things we railed at the federal government for doing and then we turned around and did exactly the same thing. I think the citizens deserve better leadership than they’re getting here this evening.”</p><p>He suggested that there was not enough information to make a decision about merging positions.</p><p>Warburton asked to weigh in saying “Frankly I didn’t see this one coming so you’ll have to be a little forgiving. I’ll have to walk back a little of what I said earlier.” He said that the town charter allows the council to amend the budget as long as no increases are made although decreases would be acceptable. He noted that it could also be adopted within the first six weeks of the fiscal year and would be retroactive.</p><p>He added “No monies can be expended for town purposes after the expiration of six weeks until after the budget shall have been adopted” apologizing for any misinformation previously.</p><p>Warburton also said he did not believe the budget would need to be readvertised as long as it did not go up.</p><p>“I’d rather see the budget pass tonight” said Goodman. “I think we’re doing a disservice to our citizens. I hate to try to bargain in public but I think that’s what we’re at now. The question I’d ask the three of you [Steele East and Radcliffe] is what would it take to pass this budget tonight?”</p><p>Goodman said that they could possibly cancel the increased rates in fixed water service fees but in order to pay for the dam study another $50000 would have to be located somewhere in the budget.</p><p>Town Manager John Hawley pointed out that the actual revenue generated by the fees would be $81000.</p><p>Goodman also offered the compromise of changing the water fees to a 12-month surcharge that would expire next year.</p><p>Clark addressed the council saying “For those of you who are up here besides the mayor I’ve been through more budgets than anyone. If I step on any toes I apologize to you up front. We’ve been hammering on this budget for 11 months. There’s not been a word said during this discussion that hasn’t been said during those 11 months. Everything that everyone’s disagreeing with was said ahead of time. No one up here came up with a way to fix it during those 11 months. No budget that we’ve had in this town in the eight years that I’ve been doing this has satisfied me. This one doesn’t either. But we have to continue our operations. And we have to work every year to try to do better at those operations. What we’re doing right now is not our job. Our job is to take care of the citizens of this town.” He pointed out that council could disagree indefinitely but this would not move things forward.</p><p>“I’m agreeing with you” said Kidd. “I think we’ve worked through it and…I think we’ve all made changes. But I think it’s a disservice if we can’t adopt this budget.”</p><p>Radcliffe pointed out that he thought funding for public vehicles was a more important use of the budget than part-time wages for the museum employees leading to further discussion of cutting back museum worker wages and bringing up again the possibility of merging the community relations and economic development positions.</p><p>“I just want to be clear that anything I’ve said here tonight wasn’t meant to be offensive to staff or anyone” said East. “I’m simply looking at a budget where we as council are obligated to give our citizens the best we can give them and I think we have an obligation to be as efficient as we can be.”</p><p>Goodman advised he wanted the same thing but that in terms of merging positions there might be an overload of work on persons holding what could amount to two jobs.</p><p>Despite this observation and after much further discussion council temporarily left the topic of the budget itself and voted to work with staff to develop a process beginning at July work session to discuss a merger of the economic development director community relations director and senior center director positions that is to be complete within 120 days.</p><p>Steele asked if council was reducing the museum employees’ funding by about $8000 was it possible to reallocate those funds for the Gatewood facility. Further discussion was pursued to determine what exact work would need to be done on it.</p><p>“Is this what council wants you want us to redo the showers redo the total bathhouse? We need some direction on what we do here” said Hawley. “We want to basically refit basically strip the structure and put everything new back in?”</p><p>“If we could just get a price get a plan of what we want to do we’d just be that much closer to actually pulling the trigger” said East.</p><p>After more debate council voted unanimously to adopt the 2013-2014 fiscal year budget with the reduction in part-time museum employees’ wages before going into a 10-minute recess.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>   </div></div>"], ["external_popularity", 0], ["fb_comments_count", 0], ["fb_id", nil], ["fb_likes_count", 0], ["fb_link", nil], ["fb_type", nil], ["image_content_type", nil], ["image_file_name", nil], ["image_file_size", nil], ["image_updated_at", nil], ["image_url", nil], ["kind", 2], ["latitude", 40.4617327], ["longitude", -80.054808], ["popularity", 0], ["published_at", Thu, 20 Jun 2013 16:38:40 UTC +00:00], ["related_story_id", nil], ["source", "The Southwest Times"], ["source_url", "http://www.southwesttimes.com/2013/06/town-council-deadlocks-on-budget-finally-passes/"], ["title", "Town council deadlocks on budget finally passes"], ["topic_id", 4], ["tweets_count", 0], ["twitter_id", nil], ["twitter_retweet_count", 0], ["updated_at", Tue, 25 Jun 2013 20:38:59 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["user_id", nil], ["views", 0]]

Photo by Teri Hoover.</p></div><p>The second time she attended the Blacksburg Regional Art Association’s monthly meeting after joining its ranks she volunteered to act as the designer in a project to update the organization’s logo brochure and website.</p><p>By December 2012 she was invited by the Town of Blacksburg to design a mural in hopes of winning the Virginia Tourism LOVEwork grant as part of the state’s social media campaign to share the message “love is at the heart of every Virginia vacation.” By April 2013 the mural was a done deed placed high on an historic building on Draper Road.</p><p>“Since coming to Blacksburg” said Bento “I have met so many people and become interested in the community and its artists. It is very important to me for people to take artists seriously especially when it comes to being professional while being creative and working as a team.”</p><p>Through the LOVEwork project and her mural called “Loving Blacksburg” Bento created relationships with downtown merchants to sell reproductions of her mural and hopefully other pieces of public art.</p><p>“To help with this process” said Bento “I created a local website with links to all the good things happening in our community.”</p><p>Through her 15 years of working as an artist in Mexico Bento was recognized as one of the most innovative artists in her hometown of Mexico City and for a couple of years was selected by international media and marketing firm Edelman as the artistic representative of children in a variety of projects.</p><p>One of those projects involved large company sponsors such as Samsung and a few top universities in Mexico City which evolved into a traveling interactive exhibit.</p><p>“The exhibit was a social experiment allowing parents and children to interact with the artistic displays in ways that taught them to collaborate with an emphasis on society environment and creative lifestyle” said Bento.</p><p>She was also the art director in several ecological and sustainable awareness projects throughout her country opening a noprofit organization promoting the cleaning of rivers by “trading trash for food.”</p><p>“Many places in the remote areas of Mexico have no efficient way of handling trash” Bento stated. “Because of that the people just dumped it into the rivers creating very polluted conditions.</p><p>“In working with the children in one of my art projects a child suggested people should be able to collect trash turn it in at a collection point and be given food in return for their efforts thereby giving them an incentive to handle the trash the right way.</p><p>“We pursued that idea in a small rural community and to this day in Mexico City this project is still done with grains and vegetables being paid to the people turning in the trash.

Photo by Teri Hoover.</p></div><p>The second time she attended the Blacksburg Regional Art Association’s monthly meeting after joining its ranks she volunteered to act as the designer in a project to update the organization’s logo brochure and website.</p><p>By December 2012 she was invited by the Town of Blacksburg to design a mural in hopes of winning the Virginia Tourism LOVEwork grant as part of the state’s social media campaign to share the message “love is at the heart of every Virginia vacation.” By April 2013 the mural was a done deed placed high on an historic building on Draper Road.</p><p>“Since coming to Blacksburg” said Bento “I have met so many people and become interested in the community and its artists. It is very important to me for people to take artists seriously especially when it comes to being professional while being creative and working as a team.”</p><p>Through the LOVEwork project and her mural called “Loving Blacksburg” Bento created relationships with downtown merchants to sell reproductions of her mural and hopefully other pieces of public art.</p><p>“To help with this process” said Bento “I created a local website with links to all the good things happening in our community.”</p><p>Through her 15 years of working as an artist in Mexico Bento was recognized as one of the most innovative artists in her hometown of Mexico City and for a couple of years was selected by international media and marketing firm Edelman as the artistic representative of children in a variety of projects.</p><p>One of those projects involved large company sponsors such as Samsung and a few top universities in Mexico City which evolved into a traveling interactive exhibit.</p><p>“The exhibit was a social experiment allowing parents and children to interact with the artistic displays in ways that taught them to collaborate with an emphasis on society environment and creative lifestyle” said Bento.</p><p>She was also the art director in several ecological and sustainable awareness projects throughout her country opening a noprofit organization promoting the cleaning of rivers by “trading trash for food.”</p><p>“Many places in the remote areas of Mexico have no efficient way of handling trash” Bento stated. “Because of that the people just dumped it into the rivers creating very polluted conditions.</p><p>“In working with the children in one of my art projects a child suggested people should be able to collect trash turn it in at a collection point and be given food in return for their efforts thereby giving them an incentive to handle the trash the right way.</p><p>“We pursued that idea in a small rural community and to this day in Mexico City this project is still done with grains and vegetables being paid to the people turning in the trash.

Laura’s heart and soul lie in the adventures of books and she is currently working on several fiction novels of her own.</p><p>What if your world was turned upside down and everything you knew about the past was a lie?  What if you were trusted with a secret that could tear your world apart? What would you do in the face of injustice?  What if your heart was torn between two suitors? In “The Elite” local author Kiera Cass’s sequel to “The Selection” young America Singer faces those heart-wrenching questions and more. Epic. Thrilling. Romantic. Those are just three words that cannot begin to describe the fast-paced story of “The Elite.” Where “The Selection” ended “The Elite” picks right up. We know America struggled with being at the palace as a participant in the Selection and now she has actually made it as far as the “Elite.” Before everything made sense. She had everything planned out. Her heart belonged to her childhood friend Aspen and as far as she was concerned he was her everything. Then she gets chosen and Aspen takes himself out the equation. Falling in love with a prince – the prince – was never an issue. Yet as she gets to know him America can’t deny that there is something about Prince Maxon. She had thought her heart was broken and that she and Maxon were strictly friends. Before America and the reader can really explore these new feelings we find that Aspen is now a guard at the palace. The decision of who holds her heart becomes trickier.  Trust becomes an issue and lives become endangered. Under the constant threat of rebel attacks and emotions she never imagined having bubbling to the surface America is faced with decisions- decisions that make her look deep within herself. While her position in “the Elite” is in question her heart is shattering and could both the Northern and Southern rebels be attacking because of the very secret America has been entrusted with? Cass has truly outdone herself. “The Elite” is elegantly written and anyone who has a romantic bone in their body is sure to love this trilogy. Many fear perhaps even the author herself that the second in a series won’t be as strong as the first. That is certainly not the case here. It might even be said that in some ways “The Elite” outshines “The Selection.”  The second book will leave readers bursting with excitement dabbing at tears and undoubtedly waiting impatiently for The One. So to those who haven’t yet read it — “The Elite” is without a doubt a must read. To those avid fans who have — are you Team Maxon or Team Aspen?  Psst! Cass’s husband says he is Team Maxon! While you’re waiting you can always read Cass’s other novels including the exciting novella “The Prince.”  The Prince shows “the Selection” through Prince Maxon’s eyes. It can only be found as an eBook at present but there is a chance it will become available in stores as a paperback at some point. It is a must read. Also keep those fingers crossed; there is still the chance The CW will move forward with the TV series based on the trilogy! Cass’s bustling personality doesn’t just show in her writing but in person as well. If you are ever at a book signing or simply run into her at random as I did you will note that she is as sweet and friendly as they come. She proves to be just as excited to give autographs and take pictures as the fans are to receive them. </p><p>Cass lives in Christiansburg with her husband and two children. She will be signing copies of her books on Tuesday June 25 7:00 p.m. at the Blacksburg Library 200 Miller Street.</p><p>-If you would like to be a guest reviewer email palston@mfrl.org.</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' LIMIT 1

June 21 2013 – Researchers have discovered a pathway by which the brain controls a molecule critical to forming long-term memories and connected with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Understanding how these ion channels are controlled is the first step to determining how their functioning or malfunctioning affects mental health.”</p><p>A single neuron in the brain can have thousands of synapses each of which can grow strengthen weaken and change structurally in response to learning new information.

The release of these chemicals is caused by the flow of electrically charged atoms through a particular subset of ion channels known as voltage-gated calcium channels.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that blocking these ion channels inhibits the formation of long-term memories. Although it was known that L-type calcium channels are activated in response to learning how they are controlled was a mystery.</p><p>In the experiment Morozov and colleagues knocked out the gene responsible for coding the enzyme Rap1 which he suspected played a role in activating L-type calcium channels. The researchers then used live imaging techniques to monitor the release of neurotransmitters and electron microscopy to visualize L-type channels at synapses. They discovered that without Rap1 the L-type calcium channels were more active and more abundant at synapses all the time increasing the release of neurotransmitters.

June 21 2013 – Eric Wong professor of animal and poultry sciences in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Virginia Tech was recently reappointed as the John W. Hancock Professor of Animal and Poultry Sciences by the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors.</p><p>The John W.

That’s work we’re not doing somewhere else.”</p><p>“I just rode around town the other day looking at our flowerbeds road repairs the list goes on and on and on that our guys are stretched to the very max right now” said Councilman Jamie Radcliffe. “I hate to enter into a promise with the Y. We get our memberships they call and say ‘Look we need repairs we gotta have this done we gotta have that done’… I’d hate to be on the receiving end of a phone call from the town manager or the assistant town manager whoever that would be wanting to know why our flowerbeds why the grass is not being cut in town yada yada yada that would not be pleasant. Just this week alone I’ve received two visits and one phone call over our roadways flowerbeds…I don’t know how you’d work it in.”</p><p>“The flowerbeds are slow but they’re coming. But that’s a different department than public works the mowing” advised Dave Hart of Public Parks and Facilities.</p><p>“I understand it’s a different department but we’re still not getting it done. That’s the bottom line” said Radcliffe. “Whoever’s department it is we’re not getting it done…I’ve had two people come by the house and a phone call. I don’t have an answer for it. We’re doing the best we can do. I’m not for sure how y’all are going to fit this in.”</p><p>Kidd asked Pedigo his thoughts on the matter.</p><p>Pedigo said “You know I think the Y’s a great facility in this town it services a great purpose. I’m a member of the Y; I try to go up there every day during lunch. I just don’t know that we have the current staff to take care of that facility. If they were to have some issue that needed to be fixed go out and pull crew off one of our pump stations to fix that and that may not happen often but it’s surely going to happen.”</p><p>Hawley pointed out that the town’s needs would take priority over the Y and maintenance work for the Y would have to be scheduled at the town’s convenience which had been made clear to the YMCA. He recommended that a decision of some sort needed to be made by council.</p><p>Councilman Greg East weighed in saying “My initial response was yes it’s a great idea but…the Y is a nonprofit organization. We have a number of nonprofit organizations certainly some of which need their grass mowed. It seems to me this may be a bit of a slippery slope in that how do you say yes to one and no to another should they ask? So that’s one concern that I have.”</p><p>He also brought up the potential unfairness of trying to distribute the 30 memberships that the Y had offered the town among 106 employees citing that more people might want them than there were to go around.</p><p>“Certainly you have valid points but the flipside is it’s an opportunity for us to try and get some programs for our citizens and our employees that are currently not available” said Worrell. “More people wanting memberships than are available–I’m not sure that problem isn’t one of the good problems to have. I’d like council to take a good hard look at that before we let it go.”</p><p>Radcliffe said “If they broke a list down of specifically what they wanted and the cost of that…”</p><p>Goodman said “We already help a number of nonprofit organizations in our community. This isn’t the first nonprofit organization in the town that we’ve supported. But unlike some of those organizations where we hand them an amount of money each year we’re getting something in return.”</p><p>He mentioned that many insurance companies are pushing wellness programs and Y memberships could lead to long-term reductions in insurance premiums for the town.</p><p>Goodman further agreed that the Y’s maintenance needs would not be top priority. “If there’s a water main break we’re not going to be mowing that lawn. So with that on balance I think there’s a way that could work.” He suggested that if memberships are not offered first to employees whose physical fitness is a job requirement such as the police fire and public works departments then memberships be distributed by a lottery system.</p><p>Radcliffe addressed Goodman’s remarks saying the council needed to consider the public at large and asked what they would get out of it not just a select few.</p><p>“That’s a valid point” said East. “While I do see it as a positive for a select few looking at the town as a whole I’m not sure it’s of the best benefit for all.”</p><p>Worrell remarked “I don’t see the reason we couldn’t try this as a pilot project. We can try it for a set period of time to see if it works. If it turns out it’s not going to work move on. As I said earlier I think it’s an opportunity to buy some services for our citizens and our employees. I’d hate to see it get away from us.”</p><p>“We really don’t know until something like this is tried” said Councilman Dave Clark. “The thing I hear out of people the most is that we don’t give our kids anything to do we don’t give our seniors anything to do the town doesn’t work with anybody else to try to make things happen good for the town.”</p><p>He continued “This is an opportunity to help keep something good in the town to give some kids a chance to do something they probably wouldn’t get to do otherwise we’ve mentioned to give seniors something to do and to give our employees a chance to improve themselves in a way they might not have been able to before. I know how stretched our staff is and how hard it is for them to fit in any new thing it’s tough but in my opinion it’s something that would be really worthwhile.”</p><p>East asked Town Attorney David Warburton if there were any legal issues to consider.</p><p>Warburton replied that the YMCA is a legitimate place to give money so long as it does not discriminate against anyone. As for other issues related to the town he said “I’m comfortable with my previous advice that you purchase the service…I’m not in favor of anything that would void the monthly water and PSA service [for the YMCA].”</p><p>He continued “You gotta be real careful that you do not cross the line from maintenance into capital improvement. And please do not ask me to define those two because I don’t know. Mr. Pedigo can tell you where you cross the line. Mow the lawn? Sounds like maintenance to me. Fixing the ceiling of the pool? That sounds like capital improvement to me.” Warburton said these are the only legal issues he is aware of.</p><p>Worrell asked if there were any further discussions or motions.</p><p>Goodman said it might be a better idea to hold off until more information was available such as a full list of what the Y wanted and what it could be balanced against in benefits for the town.</p><p>Hawley said “I think we can work on that and come back at our July meeting and do this.”</p><p>The meeting then moved on to other topics.</p><p> </p> </div></div>' LIMIT 1[0m

Photo courtesy of NRCC</p></div><p>The Old Pros Big Band Orchestra will celebrate its 40th anniversary at a special performance at New River Community College on Saturday June 22.  From 8 to 10 p.m. dancers (and listeners) will have the opportunity to enjoy the sounds of the Big Band Era in Edwards Hall room 117 at New River Community College in Dublin.</p><p>The event will also culminate the day’s events for the 1950s classes of Dublin High School whose members will celebrate a combined reunion earlier in the day at the college.</p><p>The Old Pros Concert/Dance will be free and open to the public; however donations will be accepted toward an endowed scholarship being established in the name of Dublin High School through the NRCC Educational Foundation. The scholarship will be awarded to a deserving NRCC student each year.</p><p>Even though the Big Band Era spans the period of 1920s to 1940s the Old Pros will play a few songs from the 1950s in honor of the Dublin High School reunion guests who will be in attendance.</p><p>Dean Chiapetto current conductor of the band will share his podium with founding conductor Larry Long.  Long who resides in Florida will be a guest soloist and will conduct several songs during the evening. Several other retired band members are expected to play with the band for a couple of numbers.</p><p>The Old Pros Big Band Orchestra is an all-volunteer organization that was founded at New River Community College in January 1973 by a small group of local musicians interested in preserving and playing the sounds of the Big Band Era. Since the first rehearsal in 1973 the band has grown to 28 musicians. Membership includes professionals small business owners retirees teachers and students.

I bounded into the coming season this year heading for the North Carolina beach with my daughter and a friend even as the last bell at Radford City Schools was still vibrating. This is a new practice for me. Typically I’m a late vacationer — holding off until the last month delaying departure allowing every old deadline and demand to jeopardize the potential for escape. Two years ago the Van Noy kids were told “Mid-July. No early August. Looks like mid-August for sure” and school resumed. Summer had slipped away.</p><p>Readjusting priorities has resulted in a lovely meandering sensation that has stuck with me for an entire week!

I bounded into the coming season this year heading for the North Carolina beach with my daughter and a friend even as the last bell at Radford City Schools was still vibrating.

June 24 2013 – Two undergraduate students are using research to try to unravel a historical secret lost centuries ago that has wide ranging implications for our future including lighter – and therefore more fuel efficient – cars as well as more powerful reactors for energy.</p><p>Damascus steel which was manufactured in the area that is now Syria as far back as A.D. 900 was known for its overwhelming strength and sharp blade while also being capable of bending without breaking. The metal has a distinct wavy pattern. While sword smiths have been able to replicate the appearance of Damascus steel they have not been able to reproduce its other properties after those who made it died hundreds of years ago without passing on the process.</p><p>Researchers recently analyzed ancient Damascus steel museum pieces and found the material contained carbon nanotubes – cylindrical structures made up of a highly structured for of carbon – evenly dispersed through the metal. The discovery may be part of the puzzle. At the same time in the laboratory of Barry Goodell professor of sustainable biomaterials in the College of Natural Resources and Environment another discovery showed carbon nanotubes could be formed from wood and plant fibers.</p><p>“Carbon nanotubes can be made in a variety of ways” Goodell said. “What we want to find is how they can be incorporated into steel and not just in but also aligned and dispersed.”</p><p>Two undergraduates are tackling that mystery under Goodell’s guidance this summer through the Scieneering program: Veronica Kimmerly a senior majoring in chemical engineering in the College of Engineering and mathematics in the College of Science and Beck Giesy of Sterling Va. a sophomore also majoring in mathematics.</p><p>Goodell and three other faculty members – Alan Druschitz associate professor of materials science and engineering; Scott Renneckar associate professor of sustainable biomaterials; and Xinwei Deng assistant professor of statistics – are leading the project. “The benefits this high-risk project has for you [Veronica and Beck] is that you may strike on a method that works and then be famous” Goodell told the students. “But that high risk also means there is a 95 percent chance that it won’t happen” he said with a smile.</p><p>No matter the final outcome the students are gaining a wealth of knowledge and experience. “We are trying to make samples by pressing pre-carbonized wood fiber in between steel plates” Kimmerly said. “Basically we are forming carbon nanotubes and then trying to press them into the steel.”</p><p>A few weeks into the experience Kimmerly and Giesy have created samples using a roll press creating metal pieces with constant pressure across for a consistent sample.</p><p>For some more practical skills but not for samples to test they also went to the university’s foundry to hammer out some pieces. “It is one of those life skills. If you are offered the chance to go do some blacksmithing you say yes!” Kimmerly said.</p><p>The experience has helped stretch the students’ boundaries for a positive learning experience. “The purpose of Scieneering is to do interdisciplinary research” Giesy said. “I decided to take that to the extreme and do something I had absolutely no idea about. With nanotubes this whole process is about chemistry on a micro-molecular level which I don’t know much about – I’ve just taken basic chemistry so far. I am learning it as I go and it makes it fun.”</p><p>Once the Damascus steel secret is revealed through research Goodell said it has the potential for wide-ranging benefits. The steel could be used to make cars making them lighter for better fuel efficiency while also maintaining strength for safety. In addition steel reactors could run at twice the temperature of current reactors creating more efficient output of energy.</p><p>During the summer of 2013 almost 100 students are taking part in paid undergraduate research experiences through the Fralin Life Science Institute Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship the Scieneering program Human Nutrition Foods and Exercise Summer Undergraduate Research Scholars Program the Summer Engineering Education Collaboratory program and Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Tire and Automotive Engineering. The Office of Undergraduate Research is coordinating workshops and activities for the programs’ participants through the summer.

June 24 2013 – Two undergraduate students are using research to try to unravel a historical secret lost centuries ago that has wide ranging implications for our future including lighter – and therefore more fuel efficient – cars as well as more powerful reactors for energy.</p><p>Damascus steel which was manufactured in the area that is now Syria as far back as A.D. 900 was known for its overwhelming strength and sharp blade while also being capable of bending without breaking. The metal has a distinct wavy pattern. While sword smiths have been able to replicate the appearance of Damascus steel they have not been able to reproduce its other properties after those who made it died hundreds of years ago without passing on the process.</p><p>Researchers recently analyzed ancient Damascus steel museum pieces and found the material contained carbon nanotubes – cylindrical structures made up of a highly structured for of carbon – evenly dispersed through the metal. The discovery may be part of the puzzle. At the same time in the laboratory of Barry Goodell professor of sustainable biomaterials in the College of Natural Resources and Environment another discovery showed carbon nanotubes could be formed from wood and plant fibers.</p><p>“Carbon nanotubes can be made in a variety of ways” Goodell said. “What we want to find is how they can be incorporated into steel and not just in but also aligned and dispersed.”</p><p>Two undergraduates are tackling that mystery under Goodell’s guidance this summer through the Scieneering program: Veronica Kimmerly a senior majoring in chemical engineering in the College of Engineering and mathematics in the College of Science and Beck Giesy of Sterling Va. a sophomore also majoring in mathematics.</p><p>Goodell and three other faculty members – Alan Druschitz associate professor of materials science and engineering; Scott Renneckar associate professor of sustainable biomaterials; and Xinwei Deng assistant professor of statistics – are leading the project. “The benefits this high-risk project has for you [Veronica and Beck] is that you may strike on a method that works and then be famous” Goodell told the students. “But that high risk also means there is a 95 percent chance that it won’t happen” he said with a smile.</p><p>No matter the final outcome the students are gaining a wealth of knowledge and experience. “We are trying to make samples by pressing pre-carbonized wood fiber in between steel plates” Kimmerly said. “Basically we are forming carbon nanotubes and then trying to press them into the steel.”</p><p>A few weeks into the experience Kimmerly and Giesy have created samples using a roll press creating metal pieces with constant pressure across for a consistent sample.</p><p>For some more practical skills but not for samples to test they also went to the university’s foundry to hammer out some pieces. “It is one of those life skills. If you are offered the chance to go do some blacksmithing you say yes!” Kimmerly said.</p><p>The experience has helped stretch the students’ boundaries for a positive learning experience. “The purpose of Scieneering is to do interdisciplinary research” Giesy said. “I decided to take that to the extreme and do something I had absolutely no idea about. With nanotubes this whole process is about chemistry on a micro-molecular level which I don’t know much about – I’ve just taken basic chemistry so far. I am learning it as I go and it makes it fun.”</p><p>Once the Damascus steel secret is revealed through research Goodell said it has the potential for wide-ranging benefits. The steel could be used to make cars making them lighter for better fuel efficiency while also maintaining strength for safety. In addition steel reactors could run at twice the temperature of current reactors creating more efficient output of energy.</p><p>During the summer of 2013 almost 100 students are taking part in paid undergraduate research experiences through the Fralin Life Science Institute Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship the Scieneering program Human Nutrition Foods and Exercise Summer Undergraduate Research Scholars Program the Summer Engineering Education Collaboratory program and Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Tire and Automotive Engineering. The Office of Undergraduate Research is coordinating workshops and activities for the programs’ participants through the summer. Students will present their work at the Virginia Tech Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium on Wednesday July 31.</p><div><p>Dedicated to its motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) Virginia Tech takes a hands-on engaging approach to education preparing scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities.

Many have become extended family” Newell stated.</p><p>Newell and Foutz purchased the 100-year-old building in 2003 and began renovations. The lower level of the building houses the coffee shop and a custom golf shop. Renovations where completed on the upper floor in 2010. They will retain ownership of the building while they consider their options for the future of the space.</p><p>The property located in a newly designated historic district will be advertised for lease and is zoned for retail restaurant professional offices or residential use.

The event was held at the Hilton Garden Inn Blacksburg on Wednesday June 19. Each year the chapter picks two Woman of the Year award winners one member and one non-member.</p><p>The non-member award winner was world-renowned poet writer commentator activist and educator Nikki Giovanni. In 2010 Giovanni began to plan Sheer Good Fortune a tribute to Nobel Prize for Literature winner Toni Morrison. That vision came to life in October 2012 in Burruss Auditorium with Maya Angelou and dozens of other poets and performance artists in attendance.</p><p>In her acceptance speech Giovanni talked about her efforts in continuing to advance Virginia Tech by focusing on the arts with more events like Sheer Good Fortune.

The event was held at the Hilton Garden Inn Blacksburg on Wednesday June 19. Each year the chapter picks two Woman of the Year award winners one member and one non-member.</p><p>The non-member award winner was world-renowned poet writer commentator activist and educator Nikki Giovanni. In 2010 Giovanni began to plan Sheer Good Fortune a tribute to Nobel Prize for Literature winner Toni Morrison. That vision came to life in October 2012 in Burruss Auditorium with Maya Angelou and dozens of other poets and performance artists in attendance.</p><p>In her acceptance speech Giovanni talked about her efforts in continuing to advance Virginia Tech by focusing on the arts with more events like Sheer Good Fortune.

June 25 2013 – John Bramblitt an accomplished painter who lost his vision as a young man will share his inspirational story about how art not only helped him cope but also enabled him to discover a whole new way of living at 6:30 p.m. on June 26 at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. </p><p>His presentation is part of a weeklong celebration of Vision Awareness Days sponsored by the Voice of the Blue Ridge.</p><p>While art was always a major part of Bramblitt’s life it was not until he lost his sight in 2001 that he began to paint. “Art reshaped my life” he said.</p><p>Bramblitt’s paintings take their inspiration mostly from real-life events. His workshops are unique in the art world not only because they span the gap between beginning and professional artists but also because they include adaptive techniques for artists with disabilities.</p><p>Bramblitt’s work has received much recognition including the “Most Inspirational Video of 2008” from YouTube and three Presidential Service Awards for his innovative workshops. His art has been sold in more than 20 countries and he has appeared internationally in print radio and television.</p><p>“We are honored to have John Bramblitt as part of our Vision Awareness Days” said Jan Smyth executive director of Voice of the Blue Ridge a nonprofit organization devoted to enriching the lives with vision impairments. “His artistic talent coupled with his positive can-do outlook on life will be an inspiration to all.”</p><p>Bramblitt’s presentation titled “Healing through Art” is free and open to the public. It is co-sponsored by the Creativity in Health Education Program at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. There will be a chance to meet the artist following his presentation.</p><p>“John Bramblitt’s artistic ability is extraordinary” said Dr. David Trinkle associate dean for community and culture at the school. “Even more so is his ability to inspire others — both with and without disabilities.

June 21 2013 – Researchers have discovered a pathway by which the brain controls a molecule critical to forming long-term memories and connected with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The discovery was made by a team of scientists led by Alexei Morozov an assistant professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute.</p><p>The mechanism – a protein called Rap1 – controls L-type calcium channels which participate in the formation of long-term memories. Previous studies have also linked alterations in these ion channels to certain psychiatric disorders. The discovery of the channels’ regulation by Rap1 could help scientists understand the physiological genesis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.</p><p>“People with genetic mutations affecting L-type calcium channels have higher rates of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia” said Morozov. “This suggests that there might be a relationship between the activation of L-type calcium channels and these psychiatric disorders. Understanding how these ion channels are controlled is the first step to determining how their functioning or malfunctioning affects mental health.”</p><p>A single neuron in the brain can have thousands of synapses each of which can grow strengthen weaken and change structurally in response to learning new information. Electric signals traveling from neuron to neuron jump across these synapses through chemical neurotransmitters. The release of these chemicals is caused by the flow of electrically charged atoms through a particular subset of ion channels known as voltage-gated calcium channels.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that blocking these ion channels inhibits the formation of long-term memories. Although it was known that L-type calcium channels are activated in response to learning how they are controlled was a mystery.</p><p>In the experiment Morozov and colleagues knocked out the gene responsible for coding the enzyme Rap1 which he suspected played a role in activating L-type calcium channels. The researchers then used live imaging techniques to monitor the release of neurotransmitters and electron microscopy to visualize L-type channels at synapses. They discovered that without Rap1 the L-type calcium channels were more active and more abundant at synapses all the time increasing the release of neurotransmitters. The results showed that Rap1 is responsible for suppressing L-type calcium channels allowing them to activate only at the proper moments possibly during long-term memory formation.</p><p>“Our next step is to determine whether this new signaling pathway is altered in cases of mental disease” said Morozov. “If so it could help us gain a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of channel-related psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Such knowledge would go a long way toward developing new therapeutic methods.”</p><p>The discovery appeared in The Journal of Neuroscience in the study “Rap1 Signaling Prevents L-Type Calcium Channel-Dependent Neurotransmitter Release” by Jaichandar Subramanian now a research fellow at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Louis Dye a staff scientist at the Microscopy and Imaging Core of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; and Morozov who is also an assistant professor in Virginia Tech’s School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences.</p><div><div><p>The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute joins the basic science life science bioinformatics and engineering strengths of Virginia Tech with the medical practice and medical education experience of Carilion Clinic. Virginia Tech Carilion is located in a new biomedical health sciences campus in Roanoke at 2 Riverside Circle.</p></div></div>Written by Ken Kingery.</div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 48) LIMIT 1[0m

That’s work we’re not doing somewhere else.”</p><p>“I just rode around town the other day looking at our flowerbeds road repairs the list goes on and on and on that our guys are stretched to the very max right now” said Councilman Jamie Radcliffe. “I hate to enter into a promise with the Y. We get our memberships they call and say ‘Look we need repairs we gotta have this done we gotta have that done’… I’d hate to be on the receiving end of a phone call from the town manager or the assistant town manager whoever that would be wanting to know why our flowerbeds why the grass is not being cut in town yada yada yada that would not be pleasant. Just this week alone I’ve received two visits and one phone call over our roadways flowerbeds…I don’t know how you’d work it in.”</p><p>“The flowerbeds are slow but they’re coming. But that’s a different department than public works the mowing” advised Dave Hart of Public Parks and Facilities.</p><p>“I understand it’s a different department but we’re still not getting it done. That’s the bottom line” said Radcliffe. “Whoever’s department it is we’re not getting it done…I’ve had two people come by the house and a phone call. I don’t have an answer for it. We’re doing the best we can do. I’m not for sure how y’all are going to fit this in.”</p><p>Kidd asked Pedigo his thoughts on the matter.</p><p>Pedigo said “You know I think the Y’s a great facility in this town it services a great purpose. I’m a member of the Y; I try to go up there every day during lunch. I just don’t know that we have the current staff to take care of that facility. If they were to have some issue that needed to be fixed go out and pull crew off one of our pump stations to fix that and that may not happen often but it’s surely going to happen.”</p><p>Hawley pointed out that the town’s needs would take priority over the Y and maintenance work for the Y would have to be scheduled at the town’s convenience which had been made clear to the YMCA. He recommended that a decision of some sort needed to be made by council.</p><p>Councilman Greg East weighed in saying “My initial response was yes it’s a great idea but…the Y is a nonprofit organization. We have a number of nonprofit organizations certainly some of which need their grass mowed. It seems to me this may be a bit of a slippery slope in that how do you say yes to one and no to another should they ask? So that’s one concern that I have.”</p><p>He also brought up the potential unfairness of trying to distribute the 30 memberships that the Y had offered the town among 106 employees citing that more people might want them than there were to go around.</p><p>“Certainly you have valid points but the flipside is it’s an opportunity for us to try and get some programs for our citizens and our employees that are currently not available” said Worrell. “More people wanting memberships than are available–I’m not sure that problem isn’t one of the good problems to have. I’d like council to take a good hard look at that before we let it go.”</p><p>Radcliffe said “If they broke a list down of specifically what they wanted and the cost of that…”</p><p>Goodman said “We already help a number of nonprofit organizations in our community. This isn’t the first nonprofit organization in the town that we’ve supported. But unlike some of those organizations where we hand them an amount of money each year we’re getting something in return.”</p><p>He mentioned that many insurance companies are pushing wellness programs and Y memberships could lead to long-term reductions in insurance premiums for the town.</p><p>Goodman further agreed that the Y’s maintenance needs would not be top priority. “If there’s a water main break we’re not going to be mowing that lawn. So with that on balance I think there’s a way that could work.” He suggested that if memberships are not offered first to employees whose physical fitness is a job requirement such as the police fire and public works departments then memberships be distributed by a lottery system.</p><p>Radcliffe addressed Goodman’s remarks saying the council needed to consider the public at large and asked what they would get out of it not just a select few.</p><p>“That’s a valid point” said East. “While I do see it as a positive for a select few looking at the town as a whole I’m not sure it’s of the best benefit for all.”</p><p>Worrell remarked “I don’t see the reason we couldn’t try this as a pilot project. We can try it for a set period of time to see if it works. If it turns out it’s not going to work move on. As I said earlier I think it’s an opportunity to buy some services for our citizens and our employees. I’d hate to see it get away from us.”</p><p>“We really don’t know until something like this is tried” said Councilman Dave Clark. “The thing I hear out of people the most is that we don’t give our kids anything to do we don’t give our seniors anything to do the town doesn’t work with anybody else to try to make things happen good for the town.”</p><p>He continued “This is an opportunity to help keep something good in the town to give some kids a chance to do something they probably wouldn’t get to do otherwise we’ve mentioned to give seniors something to do and to give our employees a chance to improve themselves in a way they might not have been able to before. I know how stretched our staff is and how hard it is for them to fit in any new thing it’s tough but in my opinion it’s something that would be really worthwhile.”</p><p>East asked Town Attorney David Warburton if there were any legal issues to consider.</p><p>Warburton replied that the YMCA is a legitimate place to give money so long as it does not discriminate against anyone. As for other issues related to the town he said “I’m comfortable with my previous advice that you purchase the service…I’m not in favor of anything that would void the monthly water and PSA service [for the YMCA].”</p><p>He continued “You gotta be real careful that you do not cross the line from maintenance into capital improvement. And please do not ask me to define those two because I don’t know. Mr. Pedigo can tell you where you cross the line. Mow the lawn? Sounds like maintenance to me. Fixing the ceiling of the pool? That sounds like capital improvement to me.” Warburton said these are the only legal issues he is aware of.</p><p>Worrell asked if there were any further discussions or motions.</p><p>Goodman said it might be a better idea to hold off until more information was available such as a full list of what the Y wanted and what it could be balanced against in benefits for the town.</p><p>Hawley said “I think we can work on that and come back at our July meeting and do this.”</p><p>The meeting then moved on to other topics.</p><p> </p> </div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 54) LIMIT 1[0m

Founded as a general contractor and builder of custom homes in 1988 Shelter Alternatives is recognized today as one of the finest residential builders and designers in the New River Valley. Specializing in uniquely designed homes additions and re-model projects they create sustainable construction projects with lower energy costs lower maintenance and lower impact on our environment.</p><p>Ed Tuchler describes his business as a design/build firm meaning that they offer both services. They prepare a job in the office with complete estimates and plans and then the site supervisor “makes sure that everything happens as planned” said Tuchler.</p><p>In 2005 owner and manager Tuchler purchased the business from co-founder and then owner Eric Sallee who began the business with Cliff Dowdy in 1988. Tuchler began working for Shelter on its first house as a carpenter and recognizes that “we owe a great deal to Eric and Cliff’s vision and hard work to create the company that now continues their legacy.”</p><p>Since 1993 Shelter Alternatives is a three-time recipient of the NRVHBA Builder of the Year Award and in 2011 became a six-time recipient of their Design Excellence Award. The Virginia Sustainable Building Network’s 2012 Green Innovation Award and the 2011 EarthCraft Virginia Single Family Project of the Year award are other recent accolades. Most of their recent homes are EarthCraft and Energy Star certified and the company carries both the Certified Aging in Place Specialist and Certified Green Builder designations from the National Association of Home Builders.</p><p>Shelter Alternatives expanded its vision in 2007 as it launched the Energy Check division. Using knowledge gained through years of energy-efficient building Energy Check is able to improve existing homes through energy audits and energy-efficiency retrofits.</p><p>With a busy spring and summer planned the Shelter Alternatives team shows no signs of slowing down and the New River Valley community should see that as a valuable asset for their future.</p><p>– Submitted by Caroline Bennett</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 62) LIMIT 1

Brockway inherited the bushes when he purchased his Radford home and developed an appreciation for harvesting them. — Matt Gentry | The Roanoke Times</p></div><p>Summer’s here! I bounded into the coming season this year heading for the North Carolina beach with my daughter and a friend even as the last bell at Radford City Schools was still vibrating. This is a new practice for me. Typically I’m a late vacationer — holding off until the last month delaying departure allowing every old deadline and demand to jeopardize the potential for escape. Two years ago the Van Noy kids were told “Mid-July. No early August. Looks like mid-August for sure” and school resumed. Summer had slipped away.</p><p>Readjusting priorities has resulted in a lovely meandering sensation that has stuck with me for an entire week! I still rise early but I linger over a second cup of tea or wander out to visit with my chickens before heading to the office. My husband and I walked the dogs even as dusk fell last night. After I post this column I may put on my running shoes for a slow spin along a favorite trail even if that means dinner won’t be served until 10 tonight. I could get used to this summer state of mind.</p><p>Summer officially arrived at 1:04 a.m. Friday morning — the exact time of the solstice also known as the day with the most sunlit hours of the year. Another notable astronomical benchmark will occur tomorrow with the Strawberry Moon as June’s full moon is sometimes called.</p><p>The tradition of naming full moons fascinates me. The titles range from the curious — the Full Sturgeon Moon in August — to the colorful — the Full Pink Moon in April — and even what can be called comical as in the Full Worm Moon in March.</p><p>I inquired about the basis of moon names with a practicing astronomer. Family friend Jack Brockway has a Ph.D. in physics and has taught at Radford University for eight years. Brockway was politely instructive pointing out: “For the majority of history astronomy was all about time-keeping. We didn’t know anything correct about the universe until the 1400s. Essentially every culture was agrarian until about the Renaissance so astronomical events were in perfect step with agrarian events.”</p><p>So it would stand to reason that a strawberry-picking adventure this weekend might be a timely consideration. I checked with some local berry producers to see if indeed June was the strawberry month. But few growers even admit to having the fruit. It seems that this commodity is too labor-intensive for most. There’s only one Pick-Your-Own farm with strawberries nearby if you can count Moneta as close enough.</p><p>And while local strawberries may be rare blueberries abound including in Brockway’s own yard. His wife Traci and he had “zero awareness” of the bounty that lined their front lot until after buying their home. But they have fast cultivated a fondness for the conveniently located treasure embracing the care that goes along with them.</p><p>Birds can pick a bush clean in one afternoon so Brockway erects “cages” of deer netting on a PVC frame once fruit begins to emerge. Like all good scientists and farmers he notices patterns and adds how few honeybees appear to participate in the pollination of the blueberry blossoms. “The bumblebees seem to be doing most of the work during bloom time” Brockway offers.</p><p>It could be a matter of timing. It could also relate to the growing crisis around the honeybee population. National Pollinator Week ends tomorrow. I’ve proposed extending celebrations for worthy causes in this space in the past and I’d like to do the same here. Thank your bees birds bats butterflies and beetles! This under-appreciated population is critical to our survival. “An estimated one-third of all foods and beverages is delivered by pollinators” according to the Pollinator Partnership (www.pollinator.org).</p><p>The Strawberry Moon will also be the closest to the Earth for the year. Will that make it an exceptionally large moon?</p><p>“The difference is not discernible to the human eye” Brockway insists. The moon is actually a half a degree across when measured with a protractor — an old-school science factoid. So if you think of each one as a bead you could string 360 moons across to make a semi-circle. Which is a lovely image to end on — a necklace of 360 shining silver moons.

The aquatic center has partnered with Little Leapers dance studio to offer mermaid-themed birthday parties. — Photo by Casey Richey Special to The Burgs</p></div><p>CHRISTIANSBURG — If you’re looking for something a little different for your child’s next birthday party perhaps a mermaid could be the ideal solution.</p><p>The Christiansburg Aquatic Center and Little Leapers have teamed up to bring a mermaid princess to local birthday parties. With a high-end silicone tail created by Eric Ducharme — whose clients include Walt Disney Studios and Lady Gaga — the mermaid is set to amaze both children and adults alike.</p><p>Radford University student Chelsea McGinnis portrayed the mermaid Coral during the public debut June 9 at the Christiansburg Aquatic Center.</p><p>The “Mermaid Tea Time” was catered by Mockingbird Cafe and included balloon animals face painting and a story about the mermaid’s origin. McGinnis read the story of the mermaid to the children in attendance and posed for pictures before heading to a more natural environment for a mermaid.</p><p>“We then went to the pool and played some games” McGinnis said. “We taught [the kids] how to dolphin kick and we dove for toys.”</p><p>But becoming a mermaid wasn’t an easy process. Candidates had to pass a 35-point swimming test which included treading water with a 10-pound brick overhead for two minutes swimming laps and of course being able to maneuver effectively with the tail.</p><p>“One of the things that we really wanted to focus on was safety” said Melissa Callahan the aquatic center’s facility coordinator. “We want to make sure that the mermaid is safe and that the kids at the party are safe. That was our No. 1 priority.”</p><p>Radford resident and belly dance instructor Thana Tarab was one of five mermaids selected to rotate in the role. Tarab said that although initially difficult to put on the tail it didn’t take long to get used to swimming.</p><p>“It was actually quite freeing and natural to swim with it on using undulations rather than kicks” Tarab said. “I enjoyed it very much.”</p><p>McGinnis said that adapting to life with a tail can be a bit of a challenge.</p><p>“It’s very constricting down at the bottom” McGinnis said. “But once you get the hang of it it’s really fun. Swimming and staying in character at the same time can be tough.”</p><p>In addition to the in-water tests candidates had to complete both a professional interview and one in full character as a princess something for which Little Leapers is known.</p><p>Little Leapers is a Blacksburg-based dance studio and birthday party company started in July 2012 by Heather Leeper.</p><p>The studio had humble beginnings with a weekly class at the local YMCA but has since taken off starting with the first studio at First &amp; Main shopping district in Blacksburg this past February. The company has spread with locations in Roanoke Radford Christiansburg Pearisburg and the home studio in Blacksburg.</p><p>“In our dance classes we add a lot of literature and theatrics” Leeper said.</p><p>“They’re learning that going to dance class isn’t just standing at the bar doing plies and other exercises. In a class they read say ‘Cinderella’ and at the end of class they dress up in the costumes of Cinderella and dance out her story.”</p><p>That unique style spawned the addition of princess-themed birthday parties to the repertoire and in turn to the partnership with the Christiansburg Aquatic Center.</p><p>“We were just really wowed at how well they [Little Leapers] worked with the children and how professional they were” Callahan said. “We decided to team up with them and take it to another level.”</p><p>That level is the $250 all-inclusive “Whale of a Tale” package offered by the aquatic center which includes the mermaid appearance as well as party favors food and drink and cake.</p><p>“We try to make it stress-free for the parents” Callahan said. “We do all of the planning. … We order pizzas for the children provide drinks. … Everything is taken care of all the parents have to do is send out the invitations.”</p><p>Word of mouth regarding the addition of the mermaid has helped the aquatic center book six birthday parties before the public reveal.</p><p>For now the mermaid is primarily for parties but both Leeper and Callahan indicated that the program could evolve to include swimming lessons.</p><p>– By Casey Richey Special to The Burgs</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 68) LIMIT 1

Continued upkeep on the park is one of the reasons the Pulaski County Board of Supervisors approved a tax increase this year. — The Roanoke Times file</p></div><p>CHRISTIANSBURG – With the new fiscal year about to begin local officials say that budget pressures are easing – at least somewhat – and that it is time to catch up on maintenance and other work deferred during the Recession.</p><p>“You put off for a certain amount of time” Pulaski County Board of Supervisors Chairman Joe Sheffey said Friday. “… But there is a time you have to work on that fund.”</p><p>Pulaski County is one of three New River Valley localities contacted this month who have raised taxes this year. The county boosted its real estate rate 5 cents to 59 cents per $100 assessed value and on Monday supervisors will consider raising the personal property tax rate from $2.14 to $2.35 per $100 assessed value.</p><p>Around Virginia local government budget constrictions seem to be easing though it will be months before complete data is collected several observers said.</p><p>“My broad perspective is that things have definitely improved … They’ve been through quite an experience” said John Knapp a senior economist at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia.</p><p>The Pulaski County tax increases are driven by a long list of needs that include repairing roofs windows doors and floors at fire departments buying a new fire truck and upkeep and improvements at Loving Field and Randolph Park Sheffey said.</p><p>“Historically I’m sorry to say we have not put into a capital improvements fund” Sheffey said.</p><p>Capital improvements also drove another real estate tax increase in Montgomery County – although it was a much smaller rise than the 12-cent spike that last year attracted notice across the commonwealth.</p><p>“The increase we had this year was mostly in the area of trying to start reserving some money … for future capital projects. … We know in five or six or 10 years down the road we’re going to be looking at some major improvements in Christiansburg schools” Montgomery County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jim Politis said.</p><p>Revenue from this year’s increase is being set aside for future capital projects Politis said.</p><p>In contrast last year’s increase was needed to start paying debt on the soon-to-be-finished construction of two new high schools and the upcoming renovation of a middle school.</p><p>Real estate taxes in Montgomery County rose from 87 cents to 89 cents per $100 assessed value this year and the personal property tax went from $2.45 to $2.55 per $100 assessed value. The personal property tax increase was the first in years for the county and helped meet shortfalls in several departments’ operating budgets Politis said.</p><p>Politis said a strengthening economy should increase tax revenues and put the county on a more even financial course.  “I would hope if we can continue to grow and the economy continues to recover we won’t have to have any more tax increases. My hope is this is it” Politis said.</p><p>Christiansburg Mayor Richard Ballengee called the 1.5-cent bump in the town’s real estate tax rate to 13 cents per $100 assessed value a needed adjustment to pay “just for the continuation of the services we provide … just the cost of doing business.”</p><p>“We have not had a tax increase for 30-some years” Ballengee said.</p><p>Christiansburg is giving employees a bonus this year and is continuing to subsidize water and sewer operations though the plan there is to gradually increase rates until utility operations are self-sustaining Ballengee said.</p><p>Dean Lynch deputy executive director of the Virginia Association of Counties said that last year 44 of Virginia’s 95 counties increased real estate taxes. Lynch said he expects that far fewer will increase taxes this year but said it will be fall before the association finishes collecting response to a fiscal stress survey.</p><p>Lynch said he’s heard far less about local government employees being furloughed or let go this year and that pressures from the state budget such as requirements to increase contributions to the Virginia Retirement System may be letting up somewhat.</p><p>But Jim Regimbal of Fiscal Analytics a Richmond-based tax policy consultant cautioned that “It’s going to take awhile” for local government finances to improve. Real estate assessments and accompanying tax revenue always lag a bit behind a recovery he said.</p><p>Montgomery County’s situation last year – caught between new construction needs and tightened state and federal  funding – was an “extreme example” of what local governments across Virginia will continue to face Regimbal said.</p><p>“It’s still going on” he said.</p><p>The Roanoke Times | 381-1669</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 34) LIMIT 1

Laura’s heart and soul lie in the adventures of books and she is currently working on several fiction novels of her own.</p><p>What if your world was turned upside down and everything you knew about the past was a lie?  What if you were trusted with a secret that could tear your world apart? What would you do in the face of injustice?  What if your heart was torn between two suitors? In “The Elite” local author Kiera Cass’s sequel to “The Selection” young America Singer faces those heart-wrenching questions and more. Epic. Thrilling. Romantic. Those are just three words that cannot begin to describe the fast-paced story of “The Elite.” Where “The Selection” ended “The Elite” picks right up. We know America struggled with being at the palace as a participant in the Selection and now she has actually made it as far as the “Elite.” Before everything made sense. She had everything planned out. Her heart belonged to her childhood friend Aspen and as far as she was concerned he was her everything. Then she gets chosen and Aspen takes himself out the equation. Falling in love with a prince – the prince – was never an issue. Yet as she gets to know him America can’t deny that there is something about Prince Maxon. She had thought her heart was broken and that she and Maxon were strictly friends. Before America and the reader can really explore these new feelings we find that Aspen is now a guard at the palace. The decision of who holds her heart becomes trickier.  Trust becomes an issue and lives become endangered. Under the constant threat of rebel attacks and emotions she never imagined having bubbling to the surface America is faced with decisions- decisions that make her look deep within herself. While her position in “the Elite” is in question her heart is shattering and could both the Northern and Southern rebels be attacking because of the very secret America has been entrusted with? Cass has truly outdone herself. “The Elite” is elegantly written and anyone who has a romantic bone in their body is sure to love this trilogy. Many fear perhaps even the author herself that the second in a series won’t be as strong as the first. That is certainly not the case here. It might even be said that in some ways “The Elite” outshines “The Selection.”  The second book will leave readers bursting with excitement dabbing at tears and undoubtedly waiting impatiently for The One. So to those who haven’t yet read it — “The Elite” is without a doubt a must read. To those avid fans who have — are you Team Maxon or Team Aspen?  Psst! Cass’s husband says he is Team Maxon! While you’re waiting you can always read Cass’s other novels including the exciting novella “The Prince.”  The Prince shows “the Selection” through Prince Maxon’s eyes. It can only be found as an eBook at present but there is a chance it will become available in stores as a paperback at some point. It is a must read. Also keep those fingers crossed; there is still the chance The CW will move forward with the TV series based on the trilogy! Cass’s bustling personality doesn’t just show in her writing but in person as well. If you are ever at a book signing or simply run into her at random as I did you will note that she is as sweet and friendly as they come. She proves to be just as excited to give autographs and take pictures as the fans are to receive them. </p><p>Cass lives in Christiansburg with her husband and two children. She will be signing copies of her books on Tuesday June 25 7:00 p.m. at the Blacksburg Library 200 Miller Street.</p><p>-If you would like to be a guest reviewer email palston@mfrl.org.</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 38) LIMIT 1[0m

June 24 2013 – Two undergraduate students are using research to try to unravel a historical secret lost centuries ago that has wide ranging implications for our future including lighter – and therefore more fuel efficient – cars as well as more powerful reactors for energy.</p><p>Damascus steel which was manufactured in the area that is now Syria as far back as A.D. 900 was known for its overwhelming strength and sharp blade while also being capable of bending without breaking. The metal has a distinct wavy pattern. While sword smiths have been able to replicate the appearance of Damascus steel they have not been able to reproduce its other properties after those who made it died hundreds of years ago without passing on the process.</p><p>Researchers recently analyzed ancient Damascus steel museum pieces and found the material contained carbon nanotubes – cylindrical structures made up of a highly structured for of carbon – evenly dispersed through the metal. The discovery may be part of the puzzle. At the same time in the laboratory of Barry Goodell professor of sustainable biomaterials in the College of Natural Resources and Environment another discovery showed carbon nanotubes could be formed from wood and plant fibers.</p><p>“Carbon nanotubes can be made in a variety of ways” Goodell said. “What we want to find is how they can be incorporated into steel and not just in but also aligned and dispersed.”</p><p>Two undergraduates are tackling that mystery under Goodell’s guidance this summer through the Scieneering program: Veronica Kimmerly a senior majoring in chemical engineering in the College of Engineering and mathematics in the College of Science and Beck Giesy of Sterling Va. a sophomore also majoring in mathematics.</p><p>Goodell and three other faculty members – Alan Druschitz associate professor of materials science and engineering; Scott Renneckar associate professor of sustainable biomaterials; and Xinwei Deng assistant professor of statistics – are leading the project. “The benefits this high-risk project has for you [Veronica and Beck] is that you may strike on a method that works and then be famous” Goodell told the students. “But that high risk also means there is a 95 percent chance that it won’t happen” he said with a smile.</p><p>No matter the final outcome the students are gaining a wealth of knowledge and experience. “We are trying to make samples by pressing pre-carbonized wood fiber in between steel plates” Kimmerly said. “Basically we are forming carbon nanotubes and then trying to press them into the steel.”</p><p>A few weeks into the experience Kimmerly and Giesy have created samples using a roll press creating metal pieces with constant pressure across for a consistent sample.</p><p>For some more practical skills but not for samples to test they also went to the university’s foundry to hammer out some pieces. “It is one of those life skills. If you are offered the chance to go do some blacksmithing you say yes!” Kimmerly said.</p><p>The experience has helped stretch the students’ boundaries for a positive learning experience. “The purpose of Scieneering is to do interdisciplinary research” Giesy said. “I decided to take that to the extreme and do something I had absolutely no idea about. With nanotubes this whole process is about chemistry on a micro-molecular level which I don’t know much about – I’ve just taken basic chemistry so far. I am learning it as I go and it makes it fun.”</p><p>Once the Damascus steel secret is revealed through research Goodell said it has the potential for wide-ranging benefits. The steel could be used to make cars making them lighter for better fuel efficiency while also maintaining strength for safety. In addition steel reactors could run at twice the temperature of current reactors creating more efficient output of energy.</p><p>During the summer of 2013 almost 100 students are taking part in paid undergraduate research experiences through the Fralin Life Science Institute Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship the Scieneering program Human Nutrition Foods and Exercise Summer Undergraduate Research Scholars Program the Summer Engineering Education Collaboratory program and Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Tire and Automotive Engineering. The Office of Undergraduate Research is coordinating workshops and activities for the programs’ participants through the summer. Students will present their work at the Virginia Tech Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium on Wednesday July 31.</p><div><p>Dedicated to its motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) Virginia Tech takes a hands-on engaging approach to education preparing scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the commonwealth’s most comprehensive university and its leading research institution Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to more than 30000 students and manages a research portfolio of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and by fueling economic growth and job creation locally regionally and across Virginia.</p></div></div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 76) LIMIT 1[0m

To be as all-encompassing as possible he wanted to see both sexual orientation and gender identity included in the school board’s resolution.</p><p>His sentiment was echoed by Sally Kopakowski of Blacksburg a parent of children who went through the Montgomery County Public School system.</p><p>Kopakowski came to read a letter from a transgender man who could not make it to the meeting due to a work conflict. His letter read that while he’s been fortunate enough to have positive reactions from people around him through his hormone changes and surgery others have not had such a positive experience.</p><p>After reviewing the Montgomery County Board of Supervisors’ approved resolution to expand the definition of prohibited discrimination in state government employment the school board set out to make changes to their own policy.</p><p>What threw a wrench into the process was the added sentiment from the speakers that gender identity needed to be included alongside sexual orientation.</p><p>School board member Phyllis Albritton asked if the language needs to be more specific or if sexual orientation assumes the protection of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender.</p><p>“Since it’s our policy and we want to be more specific we need to state that” said Chair B. Wendell Jones.</p><p>School Board Attorney Brad King said he clearly saw that they want to add gender identity to the policy but suggested they wait until the next meeting so they can have the exact wording they want. King wanted a chance to take a look at what other school systems have done.</p><p>“I’m not all that concerned about what other school systems are doing I think it would be great to be at the forefront of this” Albritton said.</p><p>Vice Chair Joe Ivers agreed with Albritton but said he wanted to take a step back and make sure the wording is right.</p><p>Superintendent Brenda Blackburn said the timing isn’t the best because if they hold off until the next meeting it won’t make it into printed material for the fall. She said that changes could be added to the online material.</p><p>Albritton stood her ground that the school board should go ahead and add gender identity to the policy and school board member Drema Foster said she wouldn’t vote to do that; although she didn’t disagree with it being added to the policy she wanted King to have time to investigate the wording that would most suit the school system.</p><p>Ultimately Albritton motioned to add gender identity to the policy and was seconded by Ivers but the motion failed with Jones Foster and Jamie Bond voting against and Sarah Woolsey and Penny Franklin absent.</p><p>The original proposed changes that only included sexual orientation were then passed with Jones Bond and Foster voting in favor and Albritton and Ivers against.</p><p>The school board plans to address that addition of gender identity at a future meeting.</p><p>By Deanna J.P.

The fans certainly enjoyed the atmosphere at Bogle Stadium as the DC United players and staff put on a fantastic clinic for more than 120 local children.</p><p>The main event of the evening followed with the DC United U23 squad in town to face a Roanoke Star Alumni team put together especially for the occasion. The team was coached by the Roanoke Star director of coaching and player development Graham Maclean and he was assisted by coach Mark Meyer and coach Alan Crowder. The squad for Roanoke Star consisted of solely Roanoke Star alumni and the following New River Valley players were very proud to once again wear the Roanoke Star jersey: Gillen Beck Blacksburg High School; Cole Sinclair Blacksburg High School/Roanoke College; Michael Mecham Blacksburg High School/UNC Wilmington; and Tyler Carbaugh Blacksburg High School/Roanoke College.</p><p>The game was a great advert for both programs with end-to-end action showcasing the best of soccer in Virginia. Man of the match Michael Mecham led impressively at the back and was superbly assisted by goalkeeper Cole Sinclair who produced a number of important saves to prevent the formidable DC attack from scoring. Will Hare Ian Lovern and Grayson Prillaman in midfield also provided notable performances while up front the strength and pace of current Roanoke Star coach Omar Cooke was a huge presence for Roanoke and one that enabled the powerful running of Nathaniel Scere (Emanuel’s brother) and Parker Walsh to exploit the space that was left behind.</p><p>Overall the Roanoke Star squad performed extremely well and ended up victors 1-0 after a goal in the first half from Emanuel Scere one of the current 27 Roanoke Star players who committed to play soccer in college this year. The quality of player that Roanoke Star has helped cultivate was evident throughout with a large number of Division 1 college players participating including two who played at Roanoke Star (Kyle Renfro and Garland Smith) now playing against their club team for the DC United squad.</p><p>Nearly 1000 fans were in attendance. The soccer community in Southwest Virginia will be extremely proud of the way they supported this event and helped showcase the impressive credentials of the area.</p><p>Roanoke Star Soccer Club and DC United would like to extend a huge thank you to Roanoke College Radford University Radford Soccer Club NRUSA Salem Sabres Roanoke County Parks and Recreation Hidden Valley High School and Blacksburg High School for their efforts in helping contribute to a huge win on the field and a huge victory for soccer in the Southwest area.</p><p>– Submitted by Alan Crowder Roanoke Star Soccer Club</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 84) LIMIT 1

June 25 2013 – For the fourth year in a row the Virginia Tech community exceeded its goal during "Light’s Out!/Power Down!" 2013 held on the Blacksburg campus last Thursday between 3 and 4 p.m.</p><p>"Lights Out!/Power Down!" is an annual event that demonstrates the university’s ability to reduce energy consumption in the event of an electrical grid emergency condition that could result in grid outages. It coincides with Virginia Tech’s scheduled demonstration test as part of its enrollment in the PJM Interconnection Demand Response Capacity Market program which requires the university to reduce campus electrical demand below 19000 kilowatts for a minimum period of one hour.</p><p>Preliminary results from EnergyConnect Inc. the curtailment service provider company contracted by Virginia Department of Mining Minerals and Energy to administer this program indicates the university more than exceeded its goal by reducing campus demand to an average 17586 kilowatts for the hour.</p><p>The ability to successfully demonstrate this reduction is a requirement for the university to receive a $138718 phased-in payment as the result of its successful participation in this summer’s program.</p><p>“Thanks go out again to everyone at the university who not only helped coordinate and prepare ahead of time but to all those who participated during the event as well” said Fred Selby campus energy manager with Facilities Services. “Results like these can only come from the campus community working together as a team.”</p><p>“As we did last summer the university achieved these reductions by focusing on reducing air conditioning in non-critical areas turning off lighting turning off or unplugging ‘plug loads” such as computers appliances and other electronics and running several of the campus’ larger back-up emergency generators under transferred load during the hour” said Selby.</p><p>The successful demonstration sets the stage for the rest of the 2013 summer peak demand season. As a program participant the university remains on load reduction standby each Monday through Friday from noon to 8 p.m. through the end of September in the event of an actual grid emergency.</p><p>On July 17 2012 at 1:37 p.m. for the first time since its initial summer 2010 enrollment Virginia Tech was notified that PJM Interconnection had called for a “Load Reduction Emergency Event” that afternoon.</p><p>As a result Virginia Tech was required to reduce its campus electrical demand from approximately 28500 kilowatts at the time of the call to below 20000 kilowatts by 4 p.m. and maintain that level through 8 p.m. which it did successfully.</p><div><p>Dedicated to its motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) Virginia Tech takes a hands-on engaging approach to education preparing scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the commonwealth’s most comprehensive university and its leading research institution Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to more than 30000 students and manages a research portfolio of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and by fueling economic growth and job creation locally regionally and across Virginia.</p></div></div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 89) LIMIT 1[0m

June 25 2013 – John Bramblitt an accomplished painter who lost his vision as a young man will share his inspirational story about how art not only helped him cope but also enabled him to discover a whole new way of living at 6:30 p.m. on June 26 at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. </p><p>His presentation is part of a weeklong celebration of Vision Awareness Days sponsored by the Voice of the Blue Ridge.</p><p>While art was always a major part of Bramblitt’s life it was not until he lost his sight in 2001 that he began to paint. “Art reshaped my life” he said.</p><p>Bramblitt’s paintings take their inspiration mostly from real-life events. His workshops are unique in the art world not only because they span the gap between beginning and professional artists but also because they include adaptive techniques for artists with disabilities.</p><p>Bramblitt’s work has received much recognition including the “Most Inspirational Video of 2008” from YouTube and three Presidential Service Awards for his innovative workshops. His art has been sold in more than 20 countries and he has appeared internationally in print radio and television.</p><p>“We are honored to have John Bramblitt as part of our Vision Awareness Days” said Jan Smyth executive director of Voice of the Blue Ridge a nonprofit organization devoted to enriching the lives with vision impairments. “His artistic talent coupled with his positive can-do outlook on life will be an inspiration to all.”</p><p>Bramblitt’s presentation titled “Healing through Art” is free and open to the public. It is co-sponsored by the Creativity in Health Education Program at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. There will be a chance to meet the artist following his presentation.</p><p>“John Bramblitt’s artistic ability is extraordinary” said Dr. David Trinkle associate dean for community and culture at the school. “Even more so is his ability to inspire others — both with and without disabilities. Art can enhance a person’s adaption to illness as well as promote recovery. John’s message reinforces this holistic patient-centered approach to health care that we teach our students.”</p><p>As part of Vision Awareness Days at 1 p.m.on June 29 the public will have a chance to watch Bramblitt at work as he paints to live music performed by a small ensemble at the Taubman Museum of Art. The work that he creates from this event will be displayed as part of the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine’s upcoming art exhibit “Creativity and Mental Health” which opens July 18.</p><div><div><div><p>The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute joins the basic science life science bioinformatics and engineering strengths of Virginia Tech with the medical practice and medical education experience of Carilion Clinic.

Though the venues and musicians have changed and the fireworks have gotten bigger and better the celebration remains true to its small-town-America spirit. </p><p>With a clash of symbols and a whirl of flags the Independence Day Parade will depart from the old Blacksburg Middle School property and will run through downtown. Along its route civic groups will be passing out candy to eager children and adults. If you need a break from the heat and tired feet The Lyric Theatre will offer free tickets to a classic American film. </p><p>When it’s time for dinner head over to Municipal Park and grab a bite from one of the many food vendors and enjoy the patriotic rhythms of the Blacksburg Community Band. Let the kiddos enjoy their independence at one of the park’s three playgrounds. </p><p>Since its Bicentennial Celebration in 1998 Blacksburg has put on the largest pyrotechnics display in the New River Valley. As the daylight fades nestle down on your picnic blanket and watch the fireworks show amidst the smell of blackened hot-dogs and black powder. </p><p>Around the country people celebrate our nation’s independence with sparklers cook-outs and the red white and blue. But most people can agree that the most important tradition is gathering with friends and family. </p><p>Pat Marlowe a Blacksburg resident has been attending the events for over 15 years. “The event has such a community feel. We would meet up with a group to watch the parade and bring our children. Now some bring their grandchildren. It has become such a family time. It’s part of the fabric of our family” says Marlowe. </p><p>Come make Blacksburg’s Independence Day Celebration part of your annual traditions. </p><p>This year’s events start on July 4 at 2 pm with a parade followed by a free movie An American Tail at The Lyric Theatre both sponsored by the Mt. Tabor Ruritan Club. At 6 pm come over to Municipal Park to enjoy music from the Blacksburg Community Band and stay for the Town of Blacksburg’s fireworks display at 9 pm. </p></div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 91) LIMIT 1[0m

Overall Calfee finished in 25th   place. “It was a good experience” said the PCHS record holder. “It was fun just throwing and talking to guys from all over the country.” Joe Manson of Danvers MA won the competition with a throw of 57’ 7”.</p><p>Wright competed Sunday morning and finished 5th out of 12 competitors in the third flight with her best throw of 38’8 ¼”. Overall the future James Madison University softball player placed 14th out of 42 throwers. “I was disappointed that I didn’t break 40’ this year” said the two-sport Cougar star. “But I did have a great time and we were able to compete at nationals!” Alycia Springs of Butler NC won the competition with a throw of 43’ 4 ¼”.</p> </div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 95) LIMIT 1[0m

The Pulaski infield was pulled in to cut off the run at home and Ayers chopped a ground ball to Franca at shortstop. Franca took his eye off the ball for a split second and the ball went in and out of his glove allowing Ramos to score the game-winning run.</p><p>Though the Royals came away with the win the Mariners struck first. Pulaski got a leadoff single by Joe DeCarlo and Jesus Ugueto moved him to second with a sacrifice bunt. After the sacrifice Tony DeMello doubled down the third base line to bring home DeCarlo and give the M’s a 1-0 lead.</p><p>Burlington got the run back in the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Ramos. Ramon Torres had singled to lead off the inning and moved to second after a walk to Alfredo Escalera. A grounder to first moved the runners up before Ramos tied the game with a fly ball to centerfield. Ramos later scored the winning run on the Mariners’ fielding error in the 13th.</p><p>Not to be forgotten in the opening night mini-marathon was the starting pitching for both teams. Mariners starter Edwin Diaz was perfect through the first five innings before giving up a leadoff double to Alex Newman in the sixth. Diaz recovered from the double however and retired the next three batters he faced. The right-hander pitched six scoreless innings allowing just one hit and striking out nine.</p><p>The Royals also got a quality outing from their starter Matt Tenuta. The lefty gave up just one run over six innings. He struck out six walked one and gave up three hits in his first Appalachian League start.</p><p>Neither starter factored in the decision despite their efforts. Royals reliever Jose Rodriguez got credit for the win. He pitched two scoreless innings giving up one hit and striking out two. The game’s losing pitcher was Pulaski left-hander Scott Ronnenbergh. He only pitched the 13th and did not record an out. Ronnenbergh’s line included one intentional walk two hits and one earned run.</p><p>The Royals started the season off on a high note and will meet the Mariners again for game two of the series on Friday night. Right-hander Zach Lovvorn is expected to start for Burlington against 16-year old Brazilian left-hander Luiz Gohara. First pitch is scheduled for 7 p.m. The gates at Burlington Athletic Stadium will open at 6 p.m.</p> </div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 96) LIMIT 1

With more than one award-winning horse in her stable Reid though down to earth is justifiably proud.</p><p>She appears from the barn in jeans and boots loyally followed by her German shepherd Dee and Cela a tiny Maltese and is greeted warmly by people who are at the ranch to ride.</p><p>“There’s something here just all the time” says Marilyn Conatser who rides dressage at Shadow Ranch. “Oh my gosh it’s amazing. Just fantastic.” Hannah and Natalie two young ladies who board horses there nod vigorously in agreement. “Everybody’s friends out here.”</p><p>Child and adult riding lessons are part of the ranch’s purpose but even those who can’t afford them sometimes like to bring their kids out to pet the horses in a safe environment. “We just ask that they call ahead and let us know they’re coming because our schedule is so hectic” says Reid.</p><p>Reid just got back from Oklahoma where one of her pinto mares Summer won several awards in the Pinto World Championship. “She was top 10 in the Western dressage and she was tenth and sixth in two of those classes” says Reid. “She was also ninth in her Hunter-Pleasure class for the pleasure-type horses. And then the championship that she won was what they call Tobiano pleasure-type mares.”</p><p>Reid who has been riding and showing horses for 25 years explains further “We were participating in hunt-style English riding and Western events as well as Halter which she had won. It’s really hard to describe it.

With more than one award-winning horse in her stable Reid though down to earth is justifiably proud.</p><p>She appears from the barn in jeans and boots loyally followed by her German shepherd Dee and Cela a tiny Maltese and is greeted warmly by people who are at the ranch to ride.</p><p>“There’s something here just all the time” says Marilyn Conatser who rides dressage at Shadow Ranch. “Oh my gosh it’s amazing. Just fantastic.” Hannah and Natalie two young ladies who board horses there nod vigorously in agreement. “Everybody’s friends out here.”</p><p>Child and adult riding lessons are part of the ranch’s purpose but even those who can’t afford them sometimes like to bring their kids out to pet the horses in a safe environment. “We just ask that they call ahead and let us know they’re coming because our schedule is so hectic” says Reid.</p><p>Reid just got back from Oklahoma where one of her pinto mares Summer won several awards in the Pinto World Championship. “She was top 10 in the Western dressage and she was tenth and sixth in two of those classes” says Reid. “She was also ninth in her Hunter-Pleasure class for the pleasure-type horses. And then the championship that she won was what they call Tobiano pleasure-type mares.”</p><p>Reid who has been riding and showing horses for 25 years explains further “We were participating in hunt-style English riding and Western events as well as Halter which she had won. It’s really hard to describe it. It’s where they judge horses on their way of going manners how fluid they move different things like that.”</p><p>It’s all a little confusing for anyone not versed in the ways of the equestrian world but one thing is certain: Reid and Summer were up against a lot of competition.</p><p>“It’s all over the United States” she says of the championship. “There are people there from Texas from Utah from Michigan Jersey all over the United States there were a lot of people from California there just everywhere.

Continued upkeep on the park is one of the reasons the Pulaski County Board of Supervisors approved a tax increase this year. — The Roanoke Times file</p></div><p>CHRISTIANSBURG – With the new fiscal year about to begin local officials say that budget pressures are easing – at least somewhat – and that it is time to catch up on maintenance and other work deferred during the Recession.</p><p>“You put off for a certain amount of time” Pulaski County Board of Supervisors Chairman Joe Sheffey said Friday. “… But there is a time you have to work on that fund.”</p><p>Pulaski County is one of three New River Valley localities contacted this month who have raised taxes this year. The county boosted its real estate rate 5 cents to 59 cents per $100 assessed value and on Monday supervisors will consider raising the personal property tax rate from $2.14 to $2.35 per $100 assessed value.</p><p>Around Virginia local government budget constrictions seem to be easing though it will be months before complete data is collected several observers said.</p><p>“My broad perspective is that things have definitely improved … They’ve been through quite an experience” said John Knapp a senior economist at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia.</p><p>The Pulaski County tax increases are driven by a long list of needs that include repairing roofs windows doors and floors at fire departments buying a new fire truck and upkeep and improvements at Loving Field and Randolph Park Sheffey said.</p><p>“Historically I’m sorry to say we have not put into a capital improvements fund” Sheffey said.</p><p>Capital improvements also drove another real estate tax increase in Montgomery County – although it was a much smaller rise than the 12-cent spike that last year attracted notice across the commonwealth.</p><p>“The increase we had this year was mostly in the area of trying to start reserving some money … for future capital projects. … We know in five or six or 10 years down the road we’re going to be looking at some major improvements in Christiansburg schools” Montgomery County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jim Politis said.</p><p>Revenue from this year’s increase is being set aside for future capital projects Politis said.</p><p>In contrast last year’s increase was needed to start paying debt on the soon-to-be-finished construction of two new high schools and the upcoming renovation of a middle school.</p><p>Real estate taxes in Montgomery County rose from 87 cents to 89 cents per $100 assessed value this year and the personal property tax went from $2.45 to $2.55 per $100 assessed value. The personal property tax increase was the first in years for the county and helped meet shortfalls in several departments’ operating budgets Politis said.</p><p>Politis said a strengthening economy should increase tax revenues and put the county on a more even financial course.  “I would hope if we can continue to grow and the economy continues to recover we won’t have to have any more tax increases. My hope is this is it” Politis said.</p><p>Christiansburg Mayor Richard Ballengee called the 1.5-cent bump in the town’s real estate tax rate to 13 cents per $100 assessed value a needed adjustment to pay “just for the continuation of the services we provide … just the cost of doing business.”</p><p>“We have not had a tax increase for 30-some years” Ballengee said.</p><p>Christiansburg is giving employees a bonus this year and is continuing to subsidize water and sewer operations though the plan there is to gradually increase rates until utility operations are self-sustaining Ballengee said.</p><p>Dean Lynch deputy executive director of the Virginia Association of Counties said that last year 44 of Virginia’s 95 counties increased real estate taxes. Lynch said he expects that far fewer will increase taxes this year but said it will be fall before the association finishes collecting response to a fiscal stress survey.</p><p>Lynch said he’s heard far less about local government employees being furloughed or let go this year and that pressures from the state budget such as requirements to increase contributions to the Virginia Retirement System may be letting up somewhat.</p><p>But Jim Regimbal of Fiscal Analytics a Richmond-based tax policy consultant cautioned that “It’s going to take awhile” for local government finances to improve. Real estate assessments and accompanying tax revenue always lag a bit behind a recovery he said.</p><p>Montgomery County’s situation last year – caught between new construction needs and tightened state and federal  funding – was an “extreme example” of what local governments across Virginia will continue to face Regimbal said.</p><p>“It’s still going on” he said.</p><p>The Roanoke Times | 381-1669</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 34) LIMIT 1[0m

In “The Elite” local author Kiera Cass’s sequel to “The Selection” young America Singer faces those heart-wrenching questions and more. Epic. Thrilling. Romantic. Those are just three words that cannot begin to describe the fast-paced story of “The Elite.” Where “The Selection” ended “The Elite” picks right up. We know America struggled with being at the palace as a participant in the Selection and now she has actually made it as far as the “Elite.” Before everything made sense. She had everything planned out. Her heart belonged to her childhood friend Aspen and as far as she was concerned he was her everything. Then she gets chosen and Aspen takes himself out the equation. Falling in love with a prince – the prince – was never an issue. Yet as she gets to know him America can’t deny that there is something about Prince Maxon. She had thought her heart was broken and that she and Maxon were strictly friends. Before America and the reader can really explore these new feelings we find that Aspen is now a guard at the palace. The decision of who holds her heart becomes trickier.  Trust becomes an issue and lives become endangered. Under the constant threat of rebel attacks and emotions she never imagined having bubbling to the surface America is faced with decisions- decisions that make her look deep within herself. While her position in “the Elite” is in question her heart is shattering and could both the Northern and Southern rebels be attacking because of the very secret America has been entrusted with? Cass has truly outdone herself. “The Elite” is elegantly written and anyone who has a romantic bone in their body is sure to love this trilogy. Many fear perhaps even the author herself that the second in a series won’t be as strong as the first. That is certainly not the case here. It might even be said that in some ways “The Elite” outshines “The Selection.”  The second book will leave readers bursting with excitement dabbing at tears and undoubtedly waiting impatiently for The One. So to those who haven’t yet read it — “The Elite” is without a doubt a must read. To those avid fans who have — are you Team Maxon or Team Aspen?  Psst! Cass’s husband says he is Team Maxon! While you’re waiting you can always read Cass’s other novels including the exciting novella “The Prince.”  The Prince shows “the Selection” through Prince Maxon’s eyes. It can only be found as an eBook at present but there is a chance it will become available in stores as a paperback at some point. It is a must read. Also keep those fingers crossed; there is still the chance The CW will move forward with the TV series based on the trilogy! Cass’s bustling personality doesn’t just show in her writing but in person as well. If you are ever at a book signing or simply run into her at random as I did you will note that she is as sweet and friendly as they come. She proves to be just as excited to give autographs and take pictures as the fans are to receive them. </p><p>Cass lives in Christiansburg with her husband and two children. She will be signing copies of her books on Tuesday June 25 7:00 p.m. at the Blacksburg Library 200 Miller Street.</p><p>-If you would like to be a guest reviewer email palston@mfrl.org.</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 38) LIMIT 1

June 24 2013 – Two undergraduate students are using research to try to unravel a historical secret lost centuries ago that has wide ranging implications for our future including lighter – and therefore more fuel efficient – cars as well as more powerful reactors for energy.</p><p>Damascus steel which was manufactured in the area that is now Syria as far back as A.D. 900 was known for its overwhelming strength and sharp blade while also being capable of bending without breaking. The metal has a distinct wavy pattern. While sword smiths have been able to replicate the appearance of Damascus steel they have not been able to reproduce its other properties after those who made it died hundreds of years ago without passing on the process.</p><p>Researchers recently analyzed ancient Damascus steel museum pieces and found the material contained carbon nanotubes – cylindrical structures made up of a highly structured for of carbon – evenly dispersed through the metal. The discovery may be part of the puzzle. At the same time in the laboratory of Barry Goodell professor of sustainable biomaterials in the College of Natural Resources and Environment another discovery showed carbon nanotubes could be formed from wood and plant fibers.</p><p>“Carbon nanotubes can be made in a variety of ways” Goodell said. “What we want to find is how they can be incorporated into steel and not just in but also aligned and dispersed.”</p><p>Two undergraduates are tackling that mystery under Goodell’s guidance this summer through the Scieneering program: Veronica Kimmerly a senior majoring in chemical engineering in the College of Engineering and mathematics in the College of Science and Beck Giesy of Sterling Va. a sophomore also majoring in mathematics.</p><p>Goodell and three other faculty members – Alan Druschitz associate professor of materials science and engineering; Scott Renneckar associate professor of sustainable biomaterials; and Xinwei Deng assistant professor of statistics – are leading the project. “The benefits this high-risk project has for you [Veronica and Beck] is that you may strike on a method that works and then be famous” Goodell told the students. “But that high risk also means there is a 95 percent chance that it won’t happen” he said with a smile.</p><p>No matter the final outcome the students are gaining a wealth of knowledge and experience. “We are trying to make samples by pressing pre-carbonized wood fiber in between steel plates” Kimmerly said. “Basically we are forming carbon nanotubes and then trying to press them into the steel.”</p><p>A few weeks into the experience Kimmerly and Giesy have created samples using a roll press creating metal pieces with constant pressure across for a consistent sample.</p><p>For some more practical skills but not for samples to test they also went to the university’s foundry to hammer out some pieces. “It is one of those life skills. If you are offered the chance to go do some blacksmithing you say yes!” Kimmerly said.</p><p>The experience has helped stretch the students’ boundaries for a positive learning experience. “The purpose of Scieneering is to do interdisciplinary research” Giesy said. “I decided to take that to the extreme and do something I had absolutely no idea about. With nanotubes this whole process is about chemistry on a micro-molecular level which I don’t know much about – I’ve just taken basic chemistry so far. I am learning it as I go and it makes it fun.”</p><p>Once the Damascus steel secret is revealed through research Goodell said it has the potential for wide-ranging benefits. The steel could be used to make cars making them lighter for better fuel efficiency while also maintaining strength for safety. In addition steel reactors could run at twice the temperature of current reactors creating more efficient output of energy.</p><p>During the summer of 2013 almost 100 students are taking part in paid undergraduate research experiences through the Fralin Life Science Institute Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship the Scieneering program Human Nutrition Foods and Exercise Summer Undergraduate Research Scholars Program the Summer Engineering Education Collaboratory program and Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Tire and Automotive Engineering. The Office of Undergraduate Research is coordinating workshops and activities for the programs’ participants through the summer. Students will present their work at the Virginia Tech Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium on Wednesday July 31.</p><div><p>Dedicated to its motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) Virginia Tech takes a hands-on engaging approach to education preparing scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the commonwealth’s most comprehensive university and its leading research institution Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to more than 30000 students and manages a research portfolio of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and by fueling economic growth and job creation locally regionally and across Virginia.</p></div></div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 76) LIMIT 1

His letter read that while he’s been fortunate enough to have positive reactions from people around him through his hormone changes and surgery others have not had such a positive experience.</p><p>After reviewing the Montgomery County Board of Supervisors’ approved resolution to expand the definition of prohibited discrimination in state government employment the school board set out to make changes to their own policy.</p><p>What threw a wrench into the process was the added sentiment from the speakers that gender identity needed to be included alongside sexual orientation.</p><p>School board member Phyllis Albritton asked if the language needs to be more specific or if sexual orientation assumes the protection of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender.</p><p>“Since it’s our policy and we want to be more specific we need to state that” said Chair B. Wendell Jones.</p><p>School Board Attorney Brad King said he clearly saw that they want to add gender identity to the policy but suggested they wait until the next meeting so they can have the exact wording they want. King wanted a chance to take a look at what other school systems have done.</p><p>“I’m not all that concerned about what other school systems are doing I think it would be great to be at the forefront of this” Albritton said.</p><p>Vice Chair Joe Ivers agreed with Albritton but said he wanted to take a step back and make sure the wording is right.</p><p>Superintendent Brenda Blackburn said the timing isn’t the best because if they hold off until the next meeting it won’t make it into printed material for the fall. She said that changes could be added to the online material.</p><p>Albritton stood her ground that the school board should go ahead and add gender identity to the policy and school board member Drema Foster said she wouldn’t vote to do that; although she didn’t disagree with it being added to the policy she wanted King to have time to investigate the wording that would most suit the school system.</p><p>Ultimately Albritton motioned to add gender identity to the policy and was seconded by Ivers but the motion failed with Jones Foster and Jamie Bond voting against and Sarah Woolsey and Penny Franklin absent.</p><p>The original proposed changes that only included sexual orientation were then passed with Jones Bond and Foster voting in favor and Albritton and Ivers against.</p><p>The school board plans to address that addition of gender identity at a future meeting.</p><p>By Deanna J.P.

The governor lieutenant governor attorney general members of the Virginia General Assembly and other civic leaders gave a series of lectures speeches and workshops throughout the week.</p><p>The 800 participants were divided up into 16 fictitious cities named for famous military leaders of the Eisenhower MacArthur and Patton ilk and were assigned to mock political parties for purposes of internal city elections.</p><p>By Aaron Atkins</p> <p>Tags: Boys State Governor Bob McDonnell Penelope Kyle Radford University</p> <p> This entry was posted on Monday June 24th 2013 at 6:58 am and is filed under Radford News Journal.

The team was coached by the Roanoke Star director of coaching and player development Graham Maclean and he was assisted by coach Mark Meyer and coach Alan Crowder. The squad for Roanoke Star consisted of solely Roanoke Star alumni and the following New River Valley players were very proud to once again wear the Roanoke Star jersey: Gillen Beck Blacksburg High School; Cole Sinclair Blacksburg High School/Roanoke College; Michael Mecham Blacksburg High School/UNC Wilmington; and Tyler Carbaugh Blacksburg High School/Roanoke College.</p><p>The game was a great advert for both programs with end-to-end action showcasing the best of soccer in Virginia. Man of the match Michael Mecham led impressively at the back and was superbly assisted by goalkeeper Cole Sinclair who produced a number of important saves to prevent the formidable DC attack from scoring. Will Hare Ian Lovern and Grayson Prillaman in midfield also provided notable performances while up front the strength and pace of current Roanoke Star coach Omar Cooke was a huge presence for Roanoke and one that enabled the powerful running of Nathaniel Scere (Emanuel’s brother) and Parker Walsh to exploit the space that was left behind.</p><p>Overall the Roanoke Star squad performed extremely well and ended up victors 1-0 after a goal in the first half from Emanuel Scere one of the current 27 Roanoke Star players who committed to play soccer in college this year. The quality of player that Roanoke Star has helped cultivate was evident throughout with a large number of Division 1 college players participating including two who played at Roanoke Star (Kyle Renfro and Garland Smith) now playing against their club team for the DC United squad.</p><p>Nearly 1000 fans were in attendance. The soccer community in Southwest Virginia will be extremely proud of the way they supported this event and helped showcase the impressive credentials of the area.</p><p>Roanoke Star Soccer Club and DC United would like to extend a huge thank you to Roanoke College Radford University Radford Soccer Club NRUSA Salem Sabres Roanoke County Parks and Recreation Hidden Valley High School and Blacksburg High School for their efforts in helping contribute to a huge win on the field and a huge victory for soccer in the Southwest area.</p><p>– Submitted by Alan Crowder Roanoke Star Soccer Club</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 84) LIMIT 1[0m

June 25 2013 – For the fourth year in a row the Virginia Tech community exceeded its goal during "Light’s Out!/Power Down!" 2013 held on the Blacksburg campus last Thursday between 3 and 4 p.m.</p><p>"Lights Out!/Power Down!" is an annual event that demonstrates the university’s ability to reduce energy consumption in the event of an electrical grid emergency condition that could result in grid outages. It coincides with Virginia Tech’s scheduled demonstration test as part of its enrollment in the PJM Interconnection Demand Response Capacity Market program which requires the university to reduce campus electrical demand below 19000 kilowatts for a minimum period of one hour.</p><p>Preliminary results from EnergyConnect Inc. the curtailment service provider company contracted by Virginia Department of Mining Minerals and Energy to administer this program indicates the university more than exceeded its goal by reducing campus demand to an average 17586 kilowatts for the hour.</p><p>The ability to successfully demonstrate this reduction is a requirement for the university to receive a $138718 phased-in payment as the result of its successful participation in this summer’s program.</p><p>“Thanks go out again to everyone at the university who not only helped coordinate and prepare ahead of time but to all those who participated during the event as well” said Fred Selby campus energy manager with Facilities Services. “Results like these can only come from the campus community working together as a team.”</p><p>“As we did last summer the university achieved these reductions by focusing on reducing air conditioning in non-critical areas turning off lighting turning off or unplugging ‘plug loads” such as computers appliances and other electronics and running several of the campus’ larger back-up emergency generators under transferred load during the hour” said Selby.</p><p>The successful demonstration sets the stage for the rest of the 2013 summer peak demand season. As a program participant the university remains on load reduction standby each Monday through Friday from noon to 8 p.m. through the end of September in the event of an actual grid emergency.</p><p>On July 17 2012 at 1:37 p.m. for the first time since its initial summer 2010 enrollment Virginia Tech was notified that PJM Interconnection had called for a “Load Reduction Emergency Event” that afternoon.</p><p>As a result Virginia Tech was required to reduce its campus electrical demand from approximately 28500 kilowatts at the time of the call to below 20000 kilowatts by 4 p.m. and maintain that level through 8 p.m. which it did successfully.</p><div><p>Dedicated to its motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) Virginia Tech takes a hands-on engaging approach to education preparing scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the commonwealth’s most comprehensive university and its leading research institution Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to more than 30000 students and manages a research portfolio of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and by fueling economic growth and job creation locally regionally and across Virginia.</p></div></div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 89) LIMIT 1

June 25 2013 – John Bramblitt an accomplished painter who lost his vision as a young man will share his inspirational story about how art not only helped him cope but also enabled him to discover a whole new way of living at 6:30 p.m. on June 26 at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. </p><p>His presentation is part of a weeklong celebration of Vision Awareness Days sponsored by the Voice of the Blue Ridge.</p><p>While art was always a major part of Bramblitt’s life it was not until he lost his sight in 2001 that he began to paint. “Art reshaped my life” he said.</p><p>Bramblitt’s paintings take their inspiration mostly from real-life events. His workshops are unique in the art world not only because they span the gap between beginning and professional artists but also because they include adaptive techniques for artists with disabilities.</p><p>Bramblitt’s work has received much recognition including the “Most Inspirational Video of 2008” from YouTube and three Presidential Service Awards for his innovative workshops. His art has been sold in more than 20 countries and he has appeared internationally in print radio and television.</p><p>“We are honored to have John Bramblitt as part of our Vision Awareness Days” said Jan Smyth executive director of Voice of the Blue Ridge a nonprofit organization devoted to enriching the lives with vision impairments. “His artistic talent coupled with his positive can-do outlook on life will be an inspiration to all.”</p><p>Bramblitt’s presentation titled “Healing through Art” is free and open to the public. It is co-sponsored by the Creativity in Health Education Program at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. There will be a chance to meet the artist following his presentation.</p><p>“John Bramblitt’s artistic ability is extraordinary” said Dr. David Trinkle associate dean for community and culture at the school. “Even more so is his ability to inspire others — both with and without disabilities. Art can enhance a person’s adaption to illness as well as promote recovery. John’s message reinforces this holistic patient-centered approach to health care that we teach our students.”</p><p>As part of Vision Awareness Days at 1 p.m.on June 29 the public will have a chance to watch Bramblitt at work as he paints to live music performed by a small ensemble at the Taubman Museum of Art. The work that he creates from this event will be displayed as part of the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine’s upcoming art exhibit “Creativity and Mental Health” which opens July 18.</p><div><div><div><p>The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute joins the basic science life science bioinformatics and engineering strengths of Virginia Tech with the medical practice and medical education experience of Carilion Clinic.

The Pulaski infield was pulled in to cut off the run at home and Ayers chopped a ground ball to Franca at shortstop. Franca took his eye off the ball for a split second and the ball went in and out of his glove allowing Ramos to score the game-winning run.</p><p>Though the Royals came away with the win the Mariners struck first. Pulaski got a leadoff single by Joe DeCarlo and Jesus Ugueto moved him to second with a sacrifice bunt. After the sacrifice Tony DeMello doubled down the third base line to bring home DeCarlo and give the M’s a 1-0 lead.</p><p>Burlington got the run back in the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Ramos. Ramon Torres had singled to lead off the inning and moved to second after a walk to Alfredo Escalera. A grounder to first moved the runners up before Ramos tied the game with a fly ball to centerfield. Ramos later scored the winning run on the Mariners’ fielding error in the 13th.</p><p>Not to be forgotten in the opening night mini-marathon was the starting pitching for both teams. Mariners starter Edwin Diaz was perfect through the first five innings before giving up a leadoff double to Alex Newman in the sixth. Diaz recovered from the double however and retired the next three batters he faced. The right-hander pitched six scoreless innings allowing just one hit and striking out nine.</p><p>The Royals also got a quality outing from their starter Matt Tenuta. The lefty gave up just one run over six innings. He struck out six walked one and gave up three hits in his first Appalachian League start.</p><p>Neither starter factored in the decision despite their efforts. Royals reliever Jose Rodriguez got credit for the win. He pitched two scoreless innings giving up one hit and striking out two. The game’s losing pitcher was Pulaski left-hander Scott Ronnenbergh.

Landscapes will include annuals and perennials vegetables and herbs and flowers galore. There will be formal gardens raised beds orchards and conifers.</p><p>Friends of the Pulaski County Library and New River Valley Master Gardener Association are sponsoring the 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. event.

With more than one award-winning horse in her stable Reid though down to earth is justifiably proud.</p><p>She appears from the barn in jeans and boots loyally followed by her German shepherd Dee and Cela a tiny Maltese and is greeted warmly by people who are at the ranch to ride.</p><p>“There’s something here just all the time” says Marilyn Conatser who rides dressage at Shadow Ranch. “Oh my gosh it’s amazing. Just fantastic.” Hannah and Natalie two young ladies who board horses there nod vigorously in agreement. “Everybody’s friends out here.”</p><p>Child and adult riding lessons are part of the ranch’s purpose but even those who can’t afford them sometimes like to bring their kids out to pet the horses in a safe environment. “We just ask that they call ahead and let us know they’re coming because our schedule is so hectic” says Reid.</p><p>Reid just got back from Oklahoma where one of her pinto mares Summer won several awards in the Pinto World Championship. “She was top 10 in the Western dressage and she was tenth and sixth in two of those classes” says Reid. “She was also ninth in her Hunter-Pleasure class for the pleasure-type horses. And then the championship that she won was what they call Tobiano pleasure-type mares.”</p><p>Reid who has been riding and showing horses for 25 years explains further “We were participating in hunt-style English riding and Western events as well as Halter which she had won. It’s really hard to describe it. It’s where they judge horses on their way of going manners how fluid they move different things like that.”</p><p>It’s all a little confusing for anyone not versed in the ways of the equestrian world but one thing is certain: Reid and Summer were up against a lot of competition.</p><p>“It’s all over the United States” she says of the championship. “There are people there from Texas from Utah from Michigan Jersey all over the United States there were a lot of people from California there just everywhere. And there were lots of other competitors from Virginia and from the East Coast and the Carolina area and such. But we were the only ones from this area.”</p><p>The prize’s main component turns out to be prestige not cash. “No” laughs Reid “I wish! No you get the title the ribbon and the bragging rights. It was pretty cool. We got the buckle and the champion jacket which is on order.”</p><p>Reid’s niece Jenna Barker rode Splash another Shadow Ranch horse. Splash took third fifth and sixth in his classes.</p><p>In the barn Summer stands connected to a lead outside of her stall. Her coat is mixed white and medium brown like the sort of Pinto one might see in an old Western. She looks sleek and happy and has a gentle accommodating air about her.</p><p>“That one thing I think that helped her win her class is that she’s got such intricate markings” says Reid pointing here and there affectionately touching Summer. “She’s got a Mickey Mouse on her side she’s got a maple leaf on her butt and up here she’s got a string of pearls around her neck. She’s grungy right now. She got to roll around and be a horse. Right sweetie?” she asks Summer. “This is her first big show. This horse has been shown her entire life but mostly by children. She’s a doll.”</p><p>“We raised her” Reid continues referring to her husband Erik there in the barn with her. Reid met him while training his parents’ horses. “We owned her mother and her father. We were right there when she was being born. We’ve done all of the training and the work with her ourselves. She is mainly ridden by kids. Her primary job in life is to be a lesson horse and to teach others.”</p><p>Is it at all unusual for a horse that helps train humans proper riding techniques to be shown in a championship? Reid nods vigorously.</p><p>“At this level yeah. And also for her age because she’s 18.”</p><p>“She’s 18?” asks the young woman who’s currying Summer clearly surprised.</p><p>“Yeah” laughs Reid. “She’s 18!”</p><p>Reid says she decided to put Summer into the competition because she’d always wanted to go to the Pinto World Champion show pulling Summer from her usual duty of riding lessons around six weeks ago and training her for competition. Winning doesn’t mean Summer won’t have to work anymore though.</p><p>“Now that she’s home she’ll go back into her role as a lesson horse because that’s what she does” says Reid although she point out that her riders will certainly benefit from it. “I was telling somebody how cool is it to being in a kid and say ‘This is Summer you get to ride her today and she’s a world champion” she laughs.  </p><p>“Yaaaawn Summer” says Reid putting a show halter on the mare for the camera. “Are you sleepy this morning? I don’t blame you I’m sleepy too.”</p><p>“It’s the company she keeps” teases Erik.</p><p>“I’m still exhausted too” says Reid. “It was a long trip.”</p><p>For more information about the ranch and to inquire about riding lessons call (540) 616-7001 email   horses@verizon.net or visit   www.shadowranchva.com.</p><p> </p><p> </p> </div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 107) LIMIT 1

Anthony Meredith and Officer Megan Jennings accepted the award on the department’s behalf. It was one of 12 transportation awards presented by Richard D. Holcomb commissioner of Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles and 33rd District Delegate Joe T. May (R-Leesburg).</p><p>The department was chosen for offering a variety of activities and programs aimed at pedestrian and bike safety.</p><p>For example a Bike Patrol was established in 1995 to enhance the department’s community-oriented policing. It has proven effective in familiarizing patrol officers with town citizens and businesses.</p><p>The Bike Patrol Unit consists of three officers who ride year-round as weather and staffing permits. Law enforcement agencies nationwide have found that bike patrols are effective in dealing with crimes because they can access locations where police cars cannot go and they can go places without being as readily noticed.</p><p>In May Bike Patrol officers in conjunction with Pulaski Bikes LLC held a bicycle rodeo at LewisGale Hospital-Pulaski’s annual Community Health Fair. The event offered a bicycle course instructional literature on biking safety and provided participants with properly fitting biking helmets. More than 15 people rode the course and another 90 received literature helmets or bike and pedestrian safety prizes.</p><p>During summer months these officers also patrolled the downtown area and the section of the New River Trail within the town limits. They rode the Halloween Treat Trail route promoting safety and participated in the Fire and Christmas parades by patrolling the parade routes to promote and ensure safety of parade participants and observers.</p><p>During the week of Sept. 9-15 the police department used Drive Smart Virginia materials to support Virginia Bicyclist and Pedestrian Awareness Week. The department dispersed public service announcements via newspaper radio and social media outlets reaching an estimated 9000 NRV residents.</p><p>Then in October the department’s Crime Prevention staff dispersed public service announcements via local newspapers the town newsletter radio and social media outlets promoting bicycle and pedestrian safety.</p><p>Officers also assist children walking to Pulaski Middle School in safely crossing the street each morning and afternoon while school is in session.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p> </div></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 109) LIMIT 1

Following a leadoff triple by Derrick Loveless M’s starter Jose Flores uncorked a one-out wild pitch allowing Loveless to trot home for a 2-1 Jays advantage.</p><p>Both teams then traded zeros until the home half of the seventh. M’s right fielder Wilton Martinez roped a one-out double to center and advanced to third on a Luke Guarnaccia flyout.

Dean couldn’t pick the grounder cleanly allowing Martinez to score from third.</p><p>The Pulaski comeback wasn’t meant to be however. M’s reliever Rafael Pineda struggled in his professional baseball debut allowing a crucial one-out two-run double off the bat of Silviano in the ninth.</p><p>The Mariners refused to go quietly in the ninth. Yates led off with an infield single which brought up DH Kristian Brito. After falling behind 0-2 Brito turned on a Brady Dragmire fastball but the ball died at the warning track in left. Dragmire then got Martinez to ground into a fielder’s choice before retiring Guarnaccia on strikes to record his first save.</p><p>As a result the former Texas A&amp;M Aggie Pineda took the loss in front of 559 fans at Calfee Park.</p><p>Mariners righty Jose Flores continued the dominant starting pitching through the first five games of the Appalachian League season. He threw six strong innings and allowed just three hits and two runs (both earned) in those frames. He walked one and struck out seven but walked away with a no-decision.</p><p>His counterpart former Virginia Cavalier in southpaw Scott Silverstein was equally as impressive in his Appy League debut. The 2013 25 th round selection of the Toronto Blue Jays threw six innings allowing just four hits and one earned run. Silverstein was a former teammate of Pulaski Mariner Keith Werman who also played his college ball in Charlottesville. The two faced off two times with Werman bunting for a base hit in his second appearance.</p><p>Yates led the charge for the Mariners once again on offense. The Clovis California native followed up a 4-for-5 performance Sunday night with a 2-for-4 performance. Through five games Yates is batting a whopping .450. He has three extra-base hits in the series.</p><p>Pulaski was scheduled to out the three-game series against the Blue Jays Tuesday at Calfee Park.   Full details of this game will be available Wednesday.</p> </div></div>' LIMIT 1[0m

M’s reliever Rafael Pineda struggled in his professional baseball debut allowing a crucial one-out two-run double off the bat of Silviano in the ninth.</p><p>The Mariners refused to go quietly in the ninth. Yates led off with an infield single which brought up DH Kristian Brito. After falling behind 0-2 Brito turned on a Brady Dragmire fastball but the ball died at the warning track in left. Dragmire then got Martinez to ground into a fielder’s choice before retiring Guarnaccia on strikes to record his first save.</p><p>As a result the former Texas A&amp;M Aggie Pineda took the loss in front of 559 fans at Calfee Park.</p><p>Mariners righty Jose Flores continued the dominant starting pitching through the first five games of the Appalachian League season. He threw six strong innings and allowed just three hits and two runs (both earned) in those frames. He walked one and struck out seven but walked away with a no-decision.</p><p>His counterpart former Virginia Cavalier in southpaw Scott Silverstein was equally as impressive in his Appy League debut. The 2013 25 th round selection of the Toronto Blue Jays threw six innings allowing just four hits and one earned run. Silverstein was a former teammate of Pulaski Mariner Keith Werman who also played his college ball in Charlottesville. The two faced off two times with Werman bunting for a base hit in his second appearance.</p><p>Yates led the charge for the Mariners once again on offense. The Clovis California native followed up a 4-for-5 performance Sunday night with a 2-for-4 performance. Through five games Yates is batting a whopping .450. He has three extra-base hits in the series.</p><p>Pulaski was scheduled to out the three-game series against the Blue Jays Tuesday at Calfee Park.   Full details of this game will be available Wednesday.</p>   </div></div>"], ["external_popularity", 0], ["fb_comments_count", 0], ["fb_id", nil], ["fb_likes_count", 0], ["fb_link", nil], ["fb_type", nil], ["image_content_type", nil], ["image_file_name", nil], ["image_file_size", nil], ["image_updated_at", nil], ["image_url", nil], ["kind", 2], ["latitude", 50.9605817], ["longitude", 0.1043019], ["popularity", 0], ["published_at", Wed, 26 Jun 2013 13:17:55 UTC +00:00], ["related_story_id", nil], ["source", "The Southwest Times"], ["source_url", "http://www.southwesttimes.com/2013/06/pulaski-wastes-flores-quality-start/"], ["title", "Pulaski Wastes Flores’ Quality Start"], ["topic_id", 15], ["tweets_count", 0], ["twitter_id", nil], ["twitter_retweet_count", 0], ["updated_at", Fri, 28 Jun 2013 18:32:35 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["user_id", nil], ["views", 0]]

Jennings said additional charges are pending.</p><p>The women were arrested around 10:45 p.m. Friday after the police department received an anonymous tip that a methamphetamine lab was located at Northside Apartments at 302 N.

June 27 2013 – Sumatran tigers found exclusively on the Indonesian island of Sumatra are poised on the brink of extinction. By optimistic estimates perhaps 400 individuals survive. But the exact the number and locations of the island’s dwindling tiger population has been up for debate.</p><p>Virginia Tech and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) researchers have found that tigers in central Sumatra live at very low densities lower than previously believed. Their results summarized in the paper “Threatened predator on the equator: multi-point abundance estimates of the tiger Panthera tigris in central Sumatra” were published in the April 2013 issue of Oryx–The International Journal of Conservation.</p><p>These findings by Sunarto who earned his doctorate from Virginia Tech in 2011 and co-researchers Marcella Kelly associate professor of wildlife in the College of Natural Resources and Environment and Erin Poor of East Lansing Mich. a doctoral student studying wildlife science and geospatial environmental analysis in the college suggest that high levels of human activity limit the tiger population. The results of this study which covered areas and habitat types not previously surveyed are relevant to the interventions needed to save the tiger.</p><p>“Tigers are not only threatened by habitat loss from deforestation and poaching; they are also very sensitive to human disturbance” said Sunarto a native of Indonesia where people typically have one name. “They cannot survive in areas without adequate understory but they are also threatened in seemingly suitable forests when there is too much human activity.”</p><p>The smallest surviving tiger subspecies Sumatran tigers are extremely elusive and may live at densities as low as one cat per 40 square miles. This is the first study to compare the density of Sumatran tigers across various forest types including the previously unstudied peat land. The research applied spatial estimation techniques to provide better accuracy of tiger density than previous studies.</p><p>Sunarto a tiger and elephant specialist with WWF–Indonesia collaborated on the paper with Kelly Professor Emeritus Michael Vaughan and Sybille Klenzendorf managing director of WWF’s Species Conservation Program who earned her master’s and doctorate degrees in wildlife science from Virginia Tech. The WWF field team collected data in partnership with the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry staff.</p><p>“Getting evidence of the tigers’ presence was difficult” Kelly said. “It took an average of 590 days for camera traps to get an image of each individual tiger recorded.”</p><p>“We believe the low detection of tigers in the study area of central Sumatra was a result of the high level of human activity — farming hunting trapping and gathering of forest products” Sunarto said. “We found a low population of tigers in these areas even when there was an abundance of prey animals.”</p><p>Legal protection of an area followed by intensive management can reduce the level of human disturbance and facilitate the recovery of the habitat and as well as tiger numbers. The researchers documented a potentially stable tiger population in the study region’s Tesso Nilo Park where legal efforts are in place to discourage destructive human activities.</p><p>The study indicates that more intensive monitoring and proactive management of tiger populations and their habitats are crucial or this tiger subspecies will soon follow the fate of its extinct Javan and Balinese relatives.</p><div><p>The College of Natural Resources and Environment at Virginia Tech which consistently ranks among the top three programs of its kind in the nation advances the science of sustainability. Programs prepare the future generation of leaders to address the complex natural resources issues facing the planet.

June 27 2013 – Sumatran tigers found exclusively on the Indonesian island of Sumatra are poised on the brink of extinction. By optimistic estimates perhaps 400 individuals survive. But the exact the number and locations of the island’s dwindling tiger population has been up for debate.</p><p>Virginia Tech and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) researchers have found that tigers in central Sumatra live at very low densities lower than previously believed. Their results summarized in the paper “Threatened predator on the equator: multi-point abundance estimates of the tiger Panthera tigris in central Sumatra” were published in the April 2013 issue of Oryx–The International Journal of Conservation.</p><p>These findings by Sunarto who earned his doctorate from Virginia Tech in 2011 and co-researchers Marcella Kelly associate professor of wildlife in the College of Natural Resources and Environment and Erin Poor of East Lansing Mich. a doctoral student studying wildlife science and geospatial environmental analysis in the college suggest that high levels of human activity limit the tiger population. The results of this study which covered areas and habitat types not previously surveyed are relevant to the interventions needed to save the tiger.</p><p>“Tigers are not only threatened by habitat loss from deforestation and poaching; they are also very sensitive to human disturbance” said Sunarto a native of Indonesia where people typically have one name. “They cannot survive in areas without adequate understory but they are also threatened in seemingly suitable forests when there is too much human activity.”</p><p>The smallest surviving tiger subspecies Sumatran tigers are extremely elusive and may live at densities as low as one cat per 40 square miles. This is the first study to compare the density of Sumatran tigers across various forest types including the previously unstudied peat land. The research applied spatial estimation techniques to provide better accuracy of tiger density than previous studies.</p><p>Sunarto a tiger and elephant specialist with WWF–Indonesia collaborated on the paper with Kelly Professor Emeritus Michael Vaughan and Sybille Klenzendorf managing director of WWF’s Species Conservation Program who earned her master’s and doctorate degrees in wildlife science from Virginia Tech. The WWF field team collected data in partnership with the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry staff.</p><p>“Getting evidence of the tigers’ presence was difficult” Kelly said. “It took an average of 590 days for camera traps to get an image of each individual tiger recorded.”</p><p>“We believe the low detection of tigers in the study area of central Sumatra was a result of the high level of human activity — farming hunting trapping and gathering of forest products” Sunarto said. “We found a low population of tigers in these areas even when there was an abundance of prey animals.”</p><p>Legal protection of an area followed by intensive management can reduce the level of human disturbance and facilitate the recovery of the habitat and as well as tiger numbers. The researchers documented a potentially stable tiger population in the study region’s Tesso Nilo Park where legal efforts are in place to discourage destructive human activities.</p><p>The study indicates that more intensive monitoring and proactive management of tiger populations and their habitats are crucial or this tiger subspecies will soon follow the fate of its extinct Javan and Balinese relatives.</p><div><p>The College of Natural Resources and Environment at Virginia Tech which consistently ranks among the top three programs of its kind in the nation advances the science of sustainability. Programs prepare the future generation of leaders to address the complex natural resources issues facing the planet. World-class faculty lead transformational research that complements the student learning experience and impacts citizens and communities across the globe on sustainability issues especially as they pertain to water climate fisheries wildlife forestry sustainable biomaterials ecosystems and geography.

After around an hour of discussion residents requested the county pursue a modification of one of the options.</p><p>The intention is to give members of the community a chance to see if enough community interest exists to raise money needed to fully renovate maintain and operate the gym/kitchen building as a community center. The consensus was that additional demolition can take place later if necessary but if once it’s gone it can’t be brought back.</p><p>The roof of the school sustained significant damage when an F-2 tornado tore through Draper in 2011 leaving most of the school with severe water damage. The county received around $400000 in insurance for the damage but residents were told Tuesday the estimated cost to return the old school to its “original state” before the tornado could be $1.6 million.</p><p>The second option around $875000 was to retain and renovate the gym and kitchen (the oldest part of the school) to maintain part of the community’s history but make no improvements to the cannery or cottage. A playground and pavilion attached to the gym were included in the option.</p><p>Option three would have the entire school building demolished and replaced with a 10000-square-foot metal building. A separate pavilion would be constructed adjacent to a playground but the cottage and cannery building would not be improved. This option also was estimated to cost about $1.6 million.</p><p>County Engineer Jared Linkous said the option he would have recommended to Pulaski County Board of Supervisors if pressed to do so Tuesday was the fourth option. This option estimated to cost about $440000 would demolish the entire school building and replace it with a picnic shelter restrooms and playground plus make improvements to the cannery and cottage.</p><p>Jack Murphy of Thompson &amp; Litton prepared the options and cost estimates presented at the meeting.

After around an hour of discussion residents requested the county pursue a modification of one of the options.</p><p>The intention is to give members of the community a chance to see if enough community interest exists to raise money needed to fully renovate maintain and operate the gym/kitchen building as a community center. The consensus was that additional demolition can take place later if necessary but if once it’s gone it can’t be brought back.</p><p>The roof of the school sustained significant damage when an F-2 tornado tore through Draper in 2011 leaving most of the school with severe water damage. The county received around $400000 in insurance for the damage but residents were told Tuesday the estimated cost to return the old school to its “original state” before the tornado could be $1.6 million.</p><p>The second option around $875000 was to retain and renovate the gym and kitchen (the oldest part of the school) to maintain part of the community’s history but make no improvements to the cannery or cottage. A playground and pavilion attached to the gym were included in the option.</p><p>Option three would have the entire school building demolished and replaced with a 10000-square-foot metal building. A separate pavilion would be constructed adjacent to a playground but the cottage and cannery building would not be improved. This option also was estimated to cost about $1.6 million.</p><p>County Engineer Jared Linkous said the option he would have recommended to Pulaski County Board of Supervisors if pressed to do so Tuesday was the fourth option. This option estimated to cost about $440000 would demolish the entire school building and replace it with a picnic shelter restrooms and playground plus make improvements to the cannery and cottage.</p><p>Jack Murphy of Thompson &amp; Litton prepared the options and cost estimates presented at the meeting. He said cost estimates were determined based on projects the company has bid in this area.</p><p>The projects included in the first three options were based on feedback received from citizens at earlier community meetings.

But there’s an endless number of shark species that are in serious need of conservation.”</p><p>DiMaggio says that unlike creatures that are endangered primarily because their habitat is being threatened (think melting ice caps and polar bears)  “sharks are being targeted for a body part…to me it’s ferociously cruel. To capture and an animal cut part of its body off and toss the rest of it back in the ocean. And that just really stabbed me in the heart.” He cited the documentary “Sharkwater” as his touchstone for realizing this.</p><p>Most finning takes place in Central American waters particularly around Costa Rica. The fins which are one of the most expensive seafood products in the world are sold in Asia though some is bought by a number of Chinese restaurants in America where shark fin soup can fetch up to $90 a bowl.

Their donations will be distributed to Pretoma and ARCAE two Costa Rican conservation groups.</p><p>The money comes from sponsors and donors who support Spinning to End Finning which started as an ordinary cross-country biking trip. “I had this plan ever since I was a little kid to pedal across the country” says DiMaggio. “I’m a dad and so I couldn’t take the whole entire summer so I decided to do it in stages. I did Oregon to Montana before I ever knew what was going on with sharks. I had this bike ride kind of going and I was like ‘I have to do something.’ So I thought I could integrate the bike ride with shark conservation.”</p><p>The two have encountered a lot of generosity and kindness from the people they’ve met along the way according to DiMaggio. He says that the website Warm Showers a forum for people willing to host bikers who are passing through has been a great source for finding shelter and food.

DiMaggio points out that there are only four or five shark related fatalities each year worldwide.</p><p>“Because of ‘Jaws’ so many people think sharks are vicious horrible” says DiMaggio as he puts the final nail in the coffin for misconceptions about the seagoing predators. “In the film ‘Sharkwater’ it says that more people die each year from vending machines falling on them than from shark attacks.”</p><p>“Most of the people that we talk to have either never heard of finning or have very little knowledge of it” says Lambert. “After we talk to them I think almost everyone agrees with us that it’s a wrong practice and it needs to be stopped.

Photo by Travis Williams The Burgs</p></div><p>Nearing the completion of his second term as mayor of Christiansburg Richard Ballengee announced on June 17 that he would not seek re-election this fall. Town Councilman Mike Barber is slated to run unopposed for the position in November. Ballengee’s last day in the office will be Dec. 31. Ballengee sat down last week to reflect on his eight years as mayor and share his future plans.</p><p>Q: Why did you decide not to run for re-election? A: I just turned 77. I don’t think age has that much to do with it but by the time my next term would be over I’d be in my 80s and I just felt it was time to let someone else take the reins of mayor. Though I’ve loved it — it has been the most rewarding and sort of the crowning touch to a career and I have really enjoyed working with the town but it’s time to let someone else do it.</p><p>Q: What have you enjoyed most about your time as mayor? A: I love the economic development part of it and I love the interaction with people: the citizens and the employees.</p><p>Q: During your two terms what has been your greatest challenge? A: I think the greatest challenge has probably been making sure that we have adequate services for our citizens and that we provide those services in the most friendly and cost-effective way possible. We’ve had to raise water rates at times we’ve had to raise garbage rates but compared to other localities we’re probably lower than most towns. We’re the fourth-largest town in Virginia but our tax rate is one of the lowest and I’m real pleased that we have not had a tax rate increase since 1973 until this year.</p><p>Q: What are you most proud of from your time as mayor? A: Economic development most certainly. The town has continued to grow and we’ve brought in industries that I’ve played a part in it but I didn’t do it all. The Backcountry.com that was a biggie for us. EchoStar was another biggie for us because of the employment. And then a company called Inorganic Ventures and they moved here from New Jersey. It’s a family-owned business and they’re located in the industrial park.</p><p>I think the extended bus service to Christiansburg working with Blacksburg Town Council getting the Explorer Bus that travels every 45 minutes through our downtown area taking people to the library and the courthouse town hall and government center the aquatic center the recreation center the mall area. … That’s been a tremendous service for our folks particularly our seniors. And then we’re running two buses every day from Christiansburg to Blacksburg as commuter buses and I’m very proud of that — that we can provide transportation for people who were in Blacksburg and Virginia Tech.</p><p>Recreation has been a big part of my tenure not only on council but as mayor as well. We have an outstanding recreation department and a brand new aquatic center. The completion of Harkrader Park was a real biggie for us. And it’s brought in several World Series. … We’re bringing kids from all over the country and their parents to play baseball at Harkrader Park and they not only come to play baseball they come and they spend money with us and they stay in our motels and they eat in our restaurants. That has been an economic boom for us.</p><p>I was on Christiansburg Town Council when the decision was made to build the aquatic center. The town developed a 10-year plan based on a survey of what the community wanted. And the community wanted a recreation center they wanted ball fields they wanted trails they wanted picnic areas community parks and they wanted a swimming pool. So when we adopted the 10-year plan we put all that in there. …</p><p>And so it was right at the 10th year we started construction on the aquatic center and it was a little more than I think we envisioned as we established a partnership with Virginia Tech. We were going to build a 25-meter pool and Virginia Tech came to us and said if you’ll build a 50-meter pool we’ll pay the difference. And so we entered into a contract or an agreement with Virginia Tech and they’re paying us something like $200000 a year for the next 20-some years and that’s what we’re using to pay off the debt service of the building. It has been an economic driver for us. … It is a tremendous facility.</p><p>Q: What are you going to miss the most? A: I’ll miss grand openings ribbon cuttings that sort of ceremonial part of being on the job. I’ll miss the interaction with staff here and I’ll miss the interaction I have with employees. Employees know who I am and they’re always waving at me and I love that. Responding to inquiries. Sometimes folks will call and they’ll want a sidewalk fixed. I’ll just say I don’t know how to fix a sidewalk. I can’t pave your street I can’t even drive a dump truck but I will put you in touch with who does. This has been a tremendous experience for me and I don’t give it up reluctantly but I’m going to miss it because I’ve enjoyed it so much.</p><p>Q: What advice would you give future mayors? A: The mayorship is about the position. It’s not about the individual and it’s nice to be recognized as mayor. But when I go out on the street I don’t care whether folks know I’m mayor or not. Some recognize me and I bet others probably couldn’t care less. But I think keeping a low profile you’re a spokesman for the town being careful about what you say and making sure you represent the town in a very positive way and that’s been my goal as mayor and I would give that advice to councilmen and the new mayor as well. I think that other advice would be to have a vision for Christiansburg. Not just to take hold of the office but to have something in mind that you would like to see Christiansburg be or accomplish.</p><p>Q: What’s next for Richard Ballengee? A: I really don’t know. I’ve been in Christiansburg for 50 years and am going to continue to live here and I’m going to enjoy my grandchildren and great-grandchildren and we might even do a little traveling.</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' LIMIT 1[0m

Photo by Travis Williams The Burgs</p></div><p>Nearing the completion of his second term as mayor of Christiansburg Richard Ballengee announced on June 17 that he would not seek re-election this fall. Town Councilman Mike Barber is slated to run unopposed for the position in November. Ballengee’s last day in the office will be Dec. 31. Ballengee sat down last week to reflect on his eight years as mayor and share his future plans.</p><p>Q: Why did you decide not to run for re-election? A: I just turned 77. I don’t think age has that much to do with it but by the time my next term would be over I’d be in my 80s and I just felt it was time to let someone else take the reins of mayor. Though I’ve loved it — it has been the most rewarding and sort of the crowning touch to a career and I have really enjoyed working with the town but it’s time to let someone else do it.</p><p>Q: What have you enjoyed most about your time as mayor? A: I love the economic development part of it and I love the interaction with people: the citizens and the employees.</p><p>Q: During your two terms what has been your greatest challenge? A: I think the greatest challenge has probably been making sure that we have adequate services for our citizens and that we provide those services in the most friendly and cost-effective way possible. We’ve had to raise water rates at times we’ve had to raise garbage rates but compared to other localities we’re probably lower than most towns. We’re the fourth-largest town in Virginia but our tax rate is one of the lowest and I’m real pleased that we have not had a tax rate increase since 1973 until this year.</p><p>Q: What are you most proud of from your time as mayor? A: Economic development most certainly. The town has continued to grow and we’ve brought in industries that I’ve played a part in it but I didn’t do it all. The Backcountry.com that was a biggie for us. EchoStar was another biggie for us because of the employment. And then a company called Inorganic Ventures and they moved here from New Jersey. It’s a family-owned business and they’re located in the industrial park.</p><p>I think the extended bus service to Christiansburg working with Blacksburg Town Council getting the Explorer Bus that travels every 45 minutes through our downtown area taking people to the library and the courthouse town hall and government center the aquatic center the recreation center the mall area. … That’s been a tremendous service for our folks particularly our seniors. And then we’re running two buses every day from Christiansburg to Blacksburg as commuter buses and I’m very proud of that — that we can provide transportation for people who were in Blacksburg and Virginia Tech.</p><p>Recreation has been a big part of my tenure not only on council but as mayor as well. We have an outstanding recreation department and a brand new aquatic center. The completion of Harkrader Park was a real biggie for us. And it’s brought in several World Series. … We’re bringing kids from all over the country and their parents to play baseball at Harkrader Park and they not only come to play baseball they come and they spend money with us and they stay in our motels and they eat in our restaurants. That has been an economic boom for us.</p><p>I was on Christiansburg Town Council when the decision was made to build the aquatic center. The town developed a 10-year plan based on a survey of what the community wanted. And the community wanted a recreation center they wanted ball fields they wanted trails they wanted picnic areas community parks and they wanted a swimming pool. So when we adopted the 10-year plan we put all that in there. …</p><p>And so it was right at the 10th year we started construction on the aquatic center and it was a little more than I think we envisioned as we established a partnership with Virginia Tech. We were going to build a 25-meter pool and Virginia Tech came to us and said if you’ll build a 50-meter pool we’ll pay the difference. And so we entered into a contract or an agreement with Virginia Tech and they’re paying us something like $200000 a year for the next 20-some years and that’s what we’re using to pay off the debt service of the building. It has been an economic driver for us. … It is a tremendous facility.</p><p>Q: What are you going to miss the most? A: I’ll miss grand openings ribbon cuttings that sort of ceremonial part of being on the job. I’ll miss the interaction with staff here and I’ll miss the interaction I have with employees. Employees know who I am and they’re always waving at me and I love that. Responding to inquiries. Sometimes folks will call and they’ll want a sidewalk fixed. I’ll just say I don’t know how to fix a sidewalk. I can’t pave your street I can’t even drive a dump truck but I will put you in touch with who does. This has been a tremendous experience for me and I don’t give it up reluctantly but I’m going to miss it because I’ve enjoyed it so much.</p><p>Q: What advice would you give future mayors? A: The mayorship is about the position. It’s not about the individual and it’s nice to be recognized as mayor. But when I go out on the street I don’t care whether folks know I’m mayor or not. Some recognize me and I bet others probably couldn’t care less. But I think keeping a low profile you’re a spokesman for the town being careful about what you say and making sure you represent the town in a very positive way and that’s been my goal as mayor and I would give that advice to councilmen and the new mayor as well. I think that other advice would be to have a vision for Christiansburg. Not just to take hold of the office but to have something in mind that you would like to see Christiansburg be or accomplish.</p><p>Q: What’s next for Richard Ballengee? A: I really don’t know. I’ve been in Christiansburg for 50 years and am going to continue to live here and I’m going to enjoy my grandchildren and great-grandchildren and we might even do a little traveling.</p> </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>' AND "stories"."id" != 151) LIMIT 1

It takes training and preparation—mentally physically and financially. But nothing can prepare a person for the experiences they will encounter along the way—and they run the gamut—from close calls with wild weather to “stealth camping” in an array of unfamiliar places; even the unexpected kindness of strangers.</p><p>It isn’t a story you hear every day but it is one many find compelling. Some may say it’s not necessarily the destination that matters but the journey. This is one of those stories.</p><p>Esteban 28 originally from Ecuador finished his bike tour alone but he left Los Angeles on April 1 with his 24-year-old wife of two and a half years and Pulaski native Sarah. The couple shared the beginning of their experience with friends and followers through a personal blog—www.estebanysarah.org. Their first excerpt shares their enthusiasm and some insight into what they were about to do:</p><p>“A year and a half in the planning and many more in the dreaming we are finally packed and ready to go. We’ve made the journey from quitting our jobs in Ecuador to visiting family in Virginia to now our friends’ home in California. Our bikes are tuned our gear checked and all we have to do now is wait until our scheduled departure Monday morning.”</p><p>The initial blog post goes through a list of the top eight questions they have been asked most often about their impending trip: Where are you going to sleep; what are you going to eat; how many miles a day; how did you train for this; are you following a route; what kind of gun are you carrying; is this going to cost a fortune and why?</p><p>Each is answered honestly and optimistically. A theme you’ll notice if spending any length of time with the couple.</p><p>“We started right off the bat from Death Valley Calif. in the Mojave Desert” said Esteban. “Which was quite a challenge. Painful. Lots of big hills. Very very hot. It was early April but it was already really hot. And then we got to Vegas.”</p><p>The couple actually passed through Vegas and made it to Arizona 11 days in and Sarah was beginning to show signs of knee trouble. They were traveling around 60 miles a day carrying their gear on their bikes and in spite of the training they had done it was more than Sarah’s knee could handle in the end.</p><p>“I think what ended up happening is my tendons started trying to do the work for my muscles and they were giving out” said Sarah. “So we were lying in the tent in Arizona and I woke up in the middle of the night and my knee had been hurting anyway… but this was the first time where it was hurting and I couldn’t do anything.”</p><p>Sarah said she woke up with such a realization—a fear—because she had so much pride because this was supposed be “her journey.”</p><p>“So I laid there for a couple of hours really meditating on ‘what am I going to do?’” she said. “I love hiking and kayaking and biking and I was like ‘am I going to risk my future plans just for this time?’ So it was really hard for me to decide but I’m probably going to blow out my knee if I don’t stop but I really did make … such a really mature decision to stop then when I did.”</p><p>Sarah said the two of them were scared because neither of them had really mentally prepared for anything.  They were moving from Ecuador to do their bike tour and then came what followed she said. “It changed into ‘Sarah goes home Esteban stays…he’s all alone.’”</p><p>“It was literally overnight” said Esteban. “The next morning we hitched a ride back to Vegas and she flew out and overnight literally everything changed.”</p><p>“I was on the plane and suddenly I was like ‘Oh my gosh! I just left my husband in the desert on his bicycle!’” Sarah said. She was completely heartbroken.</p><p>According to Esteban the trip took a major turn at that point and losing Sarah 11 days into the tour hit him on a lot of different levels.</p><p>“Then I’m by myself. I’m almost sort of competitive with myself like ‘how many miles can I do?’ I sort of pushed myself in a different way then” he said.</p><p>For Esteban then the trip became spiritual and solo and just a lot of mileage. A lot more Sarah said than she would have done every day. Alone he began averaging 80-85 miles a day with his biggest day being 127 miles. And in the end Esteban said he was doing 90-95 miles a day which makes them really hard.</p><p>Asked about the more dangerous parts of his trip Esteban simply said: “Well I went through Oklahoma.”</p><p>He crossed into Oklahoma on May 1. “Everybody talks there and tornado season starts May 1 so it was bad timing on that part” he said. “About two days into Oklahoma there was a big tornado warning but there wasn’t quite a tornado. I believe it was 94 degrees during the day and it went down to 29 at night and people were talking about how there was going to be a bad tornado.”</p><p>He had to stay indoors and avoid the whole thing which he said was kind of scary but nothing happened while he was there.</p><p>“After I left unfortunately for those people…And I went trhough both towns I went through El Reno and Moore both towns that were hit pretty badly” Esteban said. “I was there and I talked to the people who were there. Everybody there seems to talk about tornadoes. It’s just a daily routine I guess at this time of year.”</p><p>There were several reasons for the trip across the U.S. One was simple: they wanted to see the U.S. Esteban said he wanted to do something different; something that would require a lot of physical effort and sort of make it a spiritual journey as well.</p><p>“It would be something that would motivate me to get up every morning and do something hard and see different things” he said. “It’s a good story people like to hear about and I wanted to—in the good sense of the word—take advantage of that attention and focus (it) on something good or a greater cause if you want.”</p><p>So Esteban began allowing people to donate for different causes and he would ride for them saying he didn’t just want to pick one because a lot of them do great things “so I let people do it; sort of look inside themselves and see what it is they like…what inspires them. So people would say ‘Hey I gave $100 to the American Cancer Society’ so then okay the next 100 miles I would ride for (ACS) in a symbolic way.”</p><p>And the donations continued. Relay for Life; ASPCA; Humane Society all kinds of causes. He said he could also feel people praying for him and pulling him along. Was that encouraging for him?</p><p>“Yes it was” said Esteban explaining that for the first couple of weeks you just go at it and battle the elements and ignore the soreness but after a while you want to quit. “If you don’t have something that motivates you anymore you really just don’t want to go anymore so having that definitely helped…people are looking at you like ‘hey he’s riding for me’ so you have to perform. So just thinking about those people suffering from cancer or even if it’s just dogs in a shelter or something like that… you think about that and it gives you strength.”</p><p>Esteban described the different landscapes as “incredible” for lack of a better word. He said starting out there was just a lot of desert and it seemed like all of a sudden he was in Oklahoma.</p><p>“Everything’s green and lush and really pretty” he said. “But before that you go through Arizona New Mexico and Texas… it was a lot of desert a lot of the same.”</p><p>But he maintained there was beautiful scenery everywhere. “It’s just such a big country and so beautiful in so many ways as far as scenery” he said.</p><p>New Mexico was described as a “very interesting state” but Esteban said every state had its challenges and its great things. That’s the state he said was one of his favorites because of the “scenery being very bike friendly…a lot of youth a lot of vibrant communities and things” but it was also the state in which he racked up the most flat tires. Thirty-four out of 37 in fact.</p><p>And it also seemed that throughout his story with every ounce of trouble came a pound of kindness.</p><p>“I was on the side of the road there and again trying to fix (a flat) it’s been a long day and I’m tired and I’m just trying to find a place to sleep and it’s still like 5 p.m. still got a few hours of daylight… but this guy pulls over very nicely dressed and he just starts talking just chatting with me and asking what I’m doing” said Esteban. “No big deal.</p><p>“But then this other guy pulls over in this old pickup truck…and he gets out. Beer cans fall out of the truck and I’m like ‘oh boy’ you know… a little scared. But he comes up to me and he’s very insistent and he’s asking how he can help me… you trust people but you want to be careful too and he’s like ‘alright man go ahead’ so he leaves and I’m still putting the tire on my bike and I finally get it (fixed) and I put it back together and he pulls up again. The other guy is there just talking to me… But this guy pulls up in this pickup truck again and is like ‘Can I help you?’ again and I’m saying ‘No no really it’s okay.’ He (asks) ‘Well how about this?’ and he pulls out a piece of paper and (says) ‘I just paid for a motel room for you back in town and everything is taken care of.’”</p><p>Esteban smiled as he told story after story like this one of kind strangers inspired by his story and just trying to lend a hand.</p><p>Esteban wasn’t only on the receiving end of the help in those situations either. In fact the influence went in both directions. He shared another story of a long-distance truck driver from Los Angeles whose path he crossed repeatedly on the trip named Dale.</p><p>Once again Esteban had a flat and Dale pulled over in his rig to help. They shared stories and exchanged phone numbers; Esteban even spent a night in Dale’s truck. On a return trip Dale passed through with his bike and rode a little distance with Esteban and shared how his story was helping Dale change his life.</p><p>“We were talking about all of this and he was like ‘You know you’ve inspired me.’ He said he was giving up the long-distance trucking he said he needs to be home he needs to be more healthy … so he’s giving up” said Esteban. “He’s done actually this month. He said (will be) his last trip. He said he’s just going to be driving locally and then next year he’s going to do a long-distance bike trip too. He said he’s got to lose some weight and get back in shape… he sent me a message yesterday saying his family is very grateful for the inspiration he’s got to quit that and now they have him home every night. It’s really neat to see that effect on other people.”</p><p>Esteban’s trip rolled on through Arkansas and his terrible allergies (he almost gave up at the Mississippi River) Tennesee’s hills and valleys and finally into Virginia at the beginning of June while Sarah waited patiently here in Pulaski keeping updated and taking care of her knee.</p><p>“That was definitely my motivation at the end” said Esteban. “I just wanted to get back to her and that’s why I biked so hard… 95 miles a day in Tennessee and Virginia that’s… Whoo!”</p><p>Sarah drove to meet Esteban in Marion the day before he biked the last leg of the tour.</p><p>“We were so awkward” Sarah recalled. “We are so familiar with each other so happy to be with each other but it was so funny because we were both like ‘Let’s just hug’ because we were so shy at first.”</p><p>The next day Sarah’s family made and placed signs along the route home to encourage Esteban in his final miles bringing him to the Draper Mercantile. From there Sarah and Esteban rode the final six miles together.</p><p>Esteban said he would encourage others to go for their dreams as well.</p><p>“Go for it!” he said. “If I could quote people they would all say ‘I wish I could do what you’re doing’ but I said ‘No that may not be your thing.’ Whatever your thing is though just go ahead and do it because it’s a matter of just dropping whatever you’re doing and just embarking on this journey.”</p> </div></div>' LIMIT 1[0m

The other guy is there just talking to me… But this guy pulls up in this pickup truck again and is like ‘Can I help you?’ again and I’m saying ‘No no really it’s okay.’ He (asks) ‘Well how about this?’ and he pulls out a piece of paper and (says) ‘I just paid for a motel room for you back in town and everything is taken care of.’”</p><p>Esteban smiled as he told story after story like this one of kind strangers inspired by his story and just trying to lend a hand.</p><p>Esteban wasn’t only on the receiving end of the help in those situations either. In fact the influence went in both directions. He shared another story of a long-distance truck driver from Los Angeles whose path he crossed repeatedly on the trip named Dale.</p><p>Once again Esteban had a flat and Dale pulled over in his rig to help. They shared stories and exchanged phone numbers; Esteban even spent a night in Dale’s truck. On a return trip Dale passed through with his bike and rode a little distance with Esteban and shared how his story was helping Dale change his life.</p><p>“We were talking about all of this and he was like ‘You know you’ve inspired me.’ He said he was giving up the long-distance trucking he said he needs to be home he needs to be more healthy … so he’s giving up” said Esteban. “He’s done actually this month. He said (will be) his last trip. He said he’s just going to be driving locally and then next year he’s going to do a long-distance bike trip too. He said he’s got to lose some weight and get back in shape… he sent me a message yesterday saying his family is very grateful for the inspiration he’s got to quit that and now they have him home every night. It’s really neat to see that effect on other people.”</p><p>Esteban’s trip rolled on through Arkansas and his terrible allergies (he almost gave up at the Mississippi River) Tennesee’s hills and valleys and finally into Virginia at the beginning of June while Sarah waited patiently here in Pulaski keeping updated and taking care of her knee.</p><p>“That was definitely my motivation at the end” said Esteban. “I just wanted to get back to her and that’s why I biked so hard… 95 miles a day in Tennessee and Virginia that’s… Whoo!”</p><p>Sarah drove to meet Esteban in Marion the day before he biked the last leg of the tour.</p><p>“We were so awkward” Sarah recalled. “We are so familiar with each other so happy to be with each other but it was so funny because we were both like ‘Let’s just hug’ because we were so shy at first.”</p><p>The next day Sarah’s family made and placed signs along the route home to encourage Esteban in his final miles bringing him to the Draper Mercantile. From there Sarah and Esteban rode the final six miles together.</p><p>Esteban said he would encourage others to go for their dreams as well.</p><p>“Go for it!” he said. “If I could quote people they would all say ‘I wish I could do what you’re doing’ but I said ‘No that may not be your thing.’ Whatever your thing is though just go ahead and do it because it’s a matter of just dropping whatever you’re doing and just embarking on this journey.”</p>   </div></div>"], ["external_popularity", 0], ["fb_comments_count", 0], ["fb_id", nil], ["fb_likes_count", 0], ["fb_link", nil], ["fb_type", nil], ["image_content_type", nil], ["image_file_name", nil], ["image_file_size", nil], ["image_updated_at", nil], ["image_url", nil], ["kind", 2], ["latitude", 34.0489281], ["longitude", -111.0937311], ["popularity", 0], ["published_at", Fri, 28 Jun 2013 15:20:39 UTC +00:00], ["related_story_id", nil], ["source", "The Southwest Times"], ["source_url", "http://www.southwesttimes.com/2013/06/its-all-in-the-getting-there/"], ["title", "It’s all in the getting there"], ["topic_id", 20], ["tweets_count", 0], ["twitter_id", nil], ["twitter_retweet_count", 0], ["updated_at", Wed, 03 Jul 2013 06:07:22 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["user_id", nil], ["views", 0]]

McDonnell announces over $6.8 million in CDBG funding <p>By TRAVIS HANDY travis@southwesttimes.com</p><p>RICHMOND—Gov. Bob McDonnell Thursday announced more than $6.8 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funding for 11 projects in Virginia including one in Pulaski County.</p><p>“This program has long been providing funding for projects that continue to improve the quality of life for thousands of Virginians every year” said Gov. McDonnell. “Through Community Development Block Grants we are able to address needs across the Commonwealth including housing rehabilitation water and sewer service downtown revitalization and much more.”</p><p>Grants are awarded to 11 projects across the state among which is $700000 for the proposed Pulaski Adult Daycare and Fall Prevention Center to be located in the former Newbern Elementary School which will be remodeled using the funds. The total estimated price for the project is $705753.</p><p>The daycare and fall prevention center would be a boon to caregivers in the region who have no local alternatives for daytime care for aging family members who may have dementia or other circumstances that leave them in need of supervision and assistance while the caregivers are working or otherwise unable to be present.</p><p>Jennifer Wilsie with New River Valley Planning District Commission said earlier this spring if the grant was received the county school board would turn Newbern school over to the county which will then lease it to Pulaski Adult Daycare a nonprofit agency.</p><p>“Pulaski County is pleased and honored to have received this grant funding” said Assistant County Administrator Robert Hiss. “Several years ago a group of dedicated citizens identified a gap in services for our aging population and formed a non-profit to address this issue.  They approached the county in hopes of applying for a grant to renovate a building to accommodate an adult day care and fall prevention program.  This has been a true public-private partnership between a non-profit and a local government to create a much-needed service for our citizens.”</p><p>Hiss said the program will also benefit homebound caregivers by giving them an opportunity to re-enter the workforce when placing family members in a professional program.</p><p>“Those citizens who have dedicated their time to make this program a reality should be commended for all their hard work and passion” said Hiss.</p><p>Pulaski County Board of Supervisors’ Massie District representative Andy McCready expressed pleasure at hearing the announcement.</p><p>“I think it’s great news for our county” said McCready. As our population in the county continues to age and we have the folks that are still working trying to take care of their elderly parents at the same time they have kids to raise this represents an important assistance to those working folks that need this type of care.”</p><p>McCready said that while one of the things discussed earlier this spring concerning the center was the grant funding the board also has to work out the complete agreement with the non-profit organization that will operate the center.</p><p>While the facility’s clients would primarily be people who live and work in Pulaski County Wilsie said clients from outside the county would not be turned away. The agency is seeking licensure from Virginia Department of Social Services for 30 participants but she said there could be more than 30 people since one participant may come only two days per week and another one only three days per week.</p><p>“It is a competitive application process for these grants” said Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development Director Bill Shelton. “We utilize the funding we have to provide the maximum resources to our citizens and communities across Virginia.”</p><p>Since 1982 DHCD has administered the federally funded CDBG program and Virginia receives more than $16 million annually for this “small cities” grant program.

M’s Crush Five Homers in 12-6 Slugfest <p>Zimmerman launches first two professional home runs Guarnaccia and Ugueto go back-to-back</p><p>The Pulaski Mariners used five long balls to come from behind in a thrilling 12-6 victory against the Danville Braves at historic Calfee Park Wednesday night.</p><p>M’s sixteen year old starting pitcher Luiz Gohara made his second professional appearance and struggled mightily on the mound. Gohara allowed a first-inning run on an RBI single by Victor Caratini and couldn’t escape the second inning. After retiring the first two batters on strikeouts in the second six straight men reached to chase Gohara. He left with the bases loaded before reliever Scott Ronnenbergh retired Braves’ catcher Bryan De La Rosa on a pop-out to second.</p><p>Gohara’s final line wasn’t pretty as he allowed four hits five runs (all earned) and two walks. He struck out two and hit a batter.</p><p>The M’s got on the scoreboard in the home half of the second as Joe DeCarlo hit his first home run of the season a solo shot to straightaway center.</p><p>Danville answered with a solo blast of their own in the third a long drive off the bat of Jacob Schrader.</p><p>Pulaski rallied to cut the deficit to two in the third. Jeff Zimmerman led off the inning with his first professional home run and Ray Michel’s RBI double to the gap in right-center made the game 5-3 Braves.</p><p>The Braves extended their lead in the sixth on an infield single from Caratini that scored Kyle Wren all the way from second base.</p><p>Following the sixth inning the Braves’ bats finally were silenced. As their bats went quiet the Mariners’ bats continued to pound the baseball.</p><p>With two outs and nobody on in the bottom of the seventh Ian Miller grounded a routine grounder to Braves’ shortstop Johan Camargo whose toss across the diamond was low. First baseman Jackson Laumann couldn’t pick the low throw and the rest is history.</p><p>Keith Werman continued the two-out rally with a perfectly executed bunt down the third base line.

M’s Crush Five Homers in 12-6 Slugfest   <p>Zimmerman launches first two professional home runs Guarnaccia and Ugueto go back-to-back</p><p>The Pulaski Mariners used five long balls to come from behind in a thrilling 12-6 victory against the Danville Braves at historic Calfee Park Wednesday night.</p><p>M’s sixteen year old starting pitcher Luiz Gohara made his second professional appearance and struggled mightily on the mound. Gohara allowed a first-inning run on an RBI single by Victor Caratini and couldn’t escape the second inning. After retiring the first two batters on strikeouts in the second six straight men reached to chase Gohara. He left with the bases loaded before reliever Scott Ronnenbergh retired Braves’ catcher Bryan De La Rosa on a pop-out to second.</p><p>Gohara’s final line wasn’t pretty as he allowed four hits five runs (all earned) and two walks. He struck out two and hit a batter.</p><p>The M’s got on the scoreboard in the home half of the second as Joe DeCarlo hit his first home run of the season a solo shot to straightaway center.</p><p>Danville answered with a solo blast of their own in the third a long drive off the bat of Jacob Schrader.</p><p>Pulaski rallied to cut the deficit to two in the third. Jeff Zimmerman led off the inning with his first professional home run and Ray Michel’s RBI double to the gap in right-center made the game 5-3 Braves.</p><p>The Braves extended their lead in the sixth on an infield single from Caratini that scored Kyle Wren all the way from second base.</p><p>Following the sixth inning the Braves’ bats finally were silenced. As their bats went quiet the Mariners’ bats continued to pound the baseball.</p><p>With two outs and nobody on in the bottom of the seventh Ian Miller grounded a routine grounder to Braves’ shortstop Johan Camargo whose toss across the diamond was low. First baseman Jackson Laumann couldn’t pick the low throw and the rest is history.</p><p>Keith Werman continued the two-out rally with a perfectly executed bunt down the third base line. Jeff Zimmerman then reached on a fielder’s choice to shortstop as Werman beat the throw to second. Joe DeCarlo followed with a bases-loaded walk.</p><p>That set up the heroics for Luke Guarnaccia.</p><p>Ryan Gunther relieved Andrew Wasnak the first reliever from the Braves’ pen.

One member of that community is Braylon Foster of Pearisburg whose father Gary Foster was playing in the tournament.</p><p>Braylon was originally scheduled to celebrate his eighth birthday with a party in Pearisburg on Saturday but after hearing about the tournament he decided to relocate his celebration — cake and all — to Blacksburg.</p><p>“I care about the cancer kids” Braylon said.</p><p>While Braylon shared his cake which was decorated in University of Michigan maize and blue and a yellow ribbon in support of cancer he also shared a message to any children struggling with cancer.</p><p>“I would tell them to keep fighting it” Braylon said.</p><p>For more information about Special Love visit www.SpecialLove.org.</p>          </div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>"], ["external_popularity", 0], ["fb_comments_count", 0], ["fb_id", nil], ["fb_likes_count", 0], ["fb_link", nil], ["fb_type", nil], ["image_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["image_file_name", "open-uri20130703-82983-kpu80w"], ["image_file_size", 21418], ["image_updated_at", Wed, 03 Jul 2013 06:07:32 UTC +00:00], ["image_url", nil], ["kind", 2], ["latitude", 37.2709704], ["longitude", -79.9414266], ["popularity", 0], ["published_at", Sat, 29 Jun 2013 10:00:04 UTC +00:00], ["related_story_id", nil], ["source", "The Burgs Blog"], ["source_url", "http://blogs.roanoke.com/theburgs/features/2013/06/29/blacksburg-softball-tournament-benefits-special-love/"], ["title", "Blacksburg softball tournament benefits Special Love"], ["topic_id", 20], ["tweets_count", 0], ["twitter_id", nil], ["twitter_retweet_count", 0], ["updated_at", Wed, 03 Jul 2013 06:07:33 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["user_id", nil], ["views", 0]]

Cramer M.D. Dr. Cramer is a graduate of Georgetown Medical School and board certified in neurology. She is on the faculty at Via College of Osteopathic Medicine and currently practices at Blue Ridge Associates in Neurology in Christiansburg.</p><p>I read Dr. Alexander’s book “Proof of Heaven” with interest and anticipation.  I too have wondered how to interpret patients’ tales of near-death experiences (NDEs).  I have read articles and worked with patients in comas who “should” not have been able to remember or experience anything and yet they awoke with accurate memories of things people said in the ICU or descriptions of how a surgery felt. Scientifically speaking and from all outward clinical measures these people did not have the consciousness to hear process or create memories … and yet they did.</p><p>As I read I assumed that Dr. Alexander did not make up his story so that he could write a book. I took him at his word that he experienced what he claims to have experienced in the book. As such it is amazing from a neurological perspective that he actually remembers things that he experienced while in a medicine – and illness-induced coma.  Defying the odds he not only survived a dangerous frequently fatal illness (approximately 20 percent to 40 percent fatality even with treatment) but he also recovered well enough to return to his demanding work as a neurosurgeon. His story also beautifully outlines the dramatic shift in perception that occurs when the physician becomes the patient.</p><p>I disagree with Dr. Alexander’s implication that because of his training his experience carries more inherent validity than that of someone with less training or neurological experience. I also disagree with his implication that his story somehow provides scientific proof that heaven exists. Science by its very definition cannot validate a single experience or observation but instead tests hypotheses in the physical world. The best science tests hypotheses using a series of designed experiments not reports from individual observations.</p><p>From a scientific standpoint then I’m still not sure what to make of Dr. Alexander’s claim to have experienced a near death trip to heaven. Most NDEs documented in books stories or in patients’ descriptions directly to me have involved a period of cardiac arrest that Dr. Alexander does not document. Does that mean he did or did not have a true NDE? I don’t know. The subconscious mind can hold memories and generate vivid images that the conscious mind suppresses. Could the trip to the Earthworm’s-Eye-View and the Core have been the result of Dr. Alexander’s subconscious mind and that’s why the memories feel so real to him?  Since there are no tests or scientific studies to differentiate a conscious thought from a subconscious thought I can’t know.</p><p>My greatest conflict with Dr. Alexander’s book is not on the basis of science neurology or medicine. As a Christian I understand from reading the Bible that any visit to heaven will be filled with the gospel message of Jesus Christ the Savior. “Proof of Heaven” offers no description of Jesus the need for a savior or even the presence of human sin. In fact he asserts that he was told in heaven that there is nothing he can do wrong. This statement simply cannot be reconciled with the teachings of the Bible.</p><p>“Proof of Heaven” is a fascinating description of one man’s memories during a period in which his life hung in the balance. Did Dr. Alexander visit heaven and bring back the wisdom of the universe to share with the rest of us? Or did his bacteria-soaked brain generate brilliant hallucinations that reflected his pre-existing philosophy of life?

Their appearance in Dublin is part of their 40th anniversary tour.</p><p>With four decades of charted singles to their credit the Oak Ridge Boys have an easily recognizable sound in the music industry. They hold 12 gold three platinum and one double-platinum album in addition to one double-platinum single. The group saw more than 30 members come and go before the current lineup of Duane Allen Joe Bonsall William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban came together in the early 1970s.

July 1 2013 – A new process for making a 3-D microstructure that can be used in the analysis of cells could prove useful in counterterrorism measures and in water and food safety concerns.</p><p>The research conducted by members of Virginia Tech''s Microelectromechanical Systems Laboratory Laboratory in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is the focus of a recent article in the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers'' Journal of Microelectomechanical Systems.</p><p>In their engineering laboratory the researchers developed a new microfabrication technique to develop 3-D microfluidic devices in polymers. Microfluidics deals with the performance control and treatment of fluids that are constrained in some fashion explained Masoud Agah director of the laboratory.</p><p>As a result of this work Agah associate professor of the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and of the Virginia Tech -- Wake Forest School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences and Amy Pruden professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech have received a National Science Foundation award of $353091 to use the technology and develop new microchips named 3D-πDEP  standing for "three-dimensional passivated-electrode insulator-based dielectrophoresis" for pathogen detection.</p><p>The NSF grant will allow them to focus on the isolation of waterborne pathogens that represent one of the "grand challenges to human health costing the lives of about 2.5 million people worldwide each year" Agah and Pruden said.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization the isolation of pathogenic bacteria from the environment has not significantly changed since the 1960s when methods for chemical treatment of samples to remove background organisms were first implemented.</p><p>In the past Agah said researchers have mainly used two-dimensional microfluidic structures since this type of fabrication is more simplistic. With the 3-D device developed by Agah and his collaborators Yayha Hosseini and Phillip Zellner both graduate students in the department they are able to customize the shapes of the channels and cavities of the devices the fluids passed through.</p><p>The advantage of the fabrication process is that with a very economical technique it creates 3-D varying channels and cavities in a microfluidic structure with rounded corners as well as many other customized shapes.</p><p>These shapes are important because they resemble the living conditions as they occur naturally and this allows the use of the 3-D microfabrication technology beyond pathogen detection.</p><p>As an example in human blood vessels cells interact with each other and their surrounding environment inside circular channels. They have varying diameters along with multiple branching and joints.</p><p>"Only under this type of condition can one truly study the biology of cells within a system in vitro as if it is occurring in vivo -- our new microfluidic fabrication technology can resemble more realistically the structures of a cell''s true living conditions" Agah said. It is the introduction of the three dimensions that provides this distinctive environment.</p><p>The combination of Agah and Pruden''s expertise is important to the NSF-awarded  work.</p><p>Pruden has a broad background in applied environmental microbiology and has worked extensively in the detection and characterization of pathogens in various environmental systems. She is also leading other research efforts focused on the detection and monitoring of various pathogens and antibiotic resistant pathogens in drinking water and in wastewater.</p><p>Agah is the recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER Award for his work in 3-D micromachining and its use in microfluidics and chemical detection. Prudent also has a CAREER award as well as a presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering.</p><p>By blending their proficiencies with Agah''s group designing modeling and fabricating the chips and Pruden''s group preparing the different bacterial cultures for characterizing their dielectrophoresis properties and benchmarking it against more acceptable yet costly methods they say they believe they will be able to isolate different pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria.</p><p>To make their 3-D structure the Virginia Tech researchers used the material polydimethylsixolane known for its elastic properties similar to rubber. This material is already widely used because of its transparency biocompatibility and low-cost.</p><p>"Our work establishes a reliable and robust yet low-cost technique for the fabrication of versatile 3-D structures in polydimethylsixolane" Agad said.</p><p>Microfluidic devices can be used to trap and sort living organisms such as bacteria viruses and cells. With this new 3-D device that has a higher sensitivity and throughput than the two-dimensional version according to Agah he is able to make their predictions of applications ranging from water and food safety to fighting biological and chemical terrorism and to healthcare by fishing for abnormal cells in body fluids.</p><p>Both Hosseini of Kashan Iran and Zellner of Hampton Va. are working on their doctoral degrees. Zellner is a SMART scholarship recipient from the Department of Defense.</p><div><p>The College of Engineering at Virginia Tech is internationally recognized for its excellence in 14 engineering disciplines and computer science. The college''s 6000 undergraduates benefit from an innovative curriculum that provides a "hands-on minds-on" approach to engineering education complementing classroom instruction with two unique design-and-build facilities and a strong Cooperative Education Program. With more than 50 research centers and numerous laboratories the college offers its 2000 graduate students opportunities in advanced fields of study such as biomedical engineering state-of-the-art microelectronics and nanotechnology.

With the 3-D device developed by Agah and his collaborators Yayha Hosseini and Phillip Zellner both graduate students in the department they are able to customize the shapes of the channels and cavities of the devices the fluids passed through.</p><p>The advantage of the fabrication process is that with a very economical technique it creates 3-D varying channels and cavities in a microfluidic structure with rounded corners as well as many other customized shapes.</p><p>These shapes are important because they resemble the living conditions as they occur naturally and this allows the use of the 3-D microfabrication technology beyond pathogen detection.</p><p>As an example in human blood vessels cells interact with each other and their surrounding environment inside circular channels. They have varying diameters along with multiple branching and joints.</p><p>\"Only under this type of condition can one truly study the biology of cells within a system in vitro as if it is occurring in vivo -- our new microfluidic fabrication technology can resemble more realistically the structures of a cell's true living conditions\" Agah said. It is the introduction of the three dimensions that provides this distinctive environment.</p><p>The combination of Agah and Pruden's expertise is important to the NSF-awarded  work.</p><p>Pruden has a broad background in applied environmental microbiology and has worked extensively in the detection and characterization of pathogens in various environmental systems. She is also leading other research efforts focused on the detection and monitoring of various pathogens and antibiotic resistant pathogens in drinking water and in wastewater.</p><p>Agah is the recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER Award for his work in 3-D micromachining and its use in microfluidics and chemical detection. Prudent also has a CAREER award as well as a presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering.</p><p>By blending their proficiencies with Agah's group designing modeling and fabricating the chips and Pruden's group preparing the different bacterial cultures for characterizing their dielectrophoresis properties and benchmarking it against more acceptable yet costly methods they say they believe they will be able to isolate different pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria.</p><p>To make their 3-D structure the Virginia Tech researchers used the material polydimethylsixolane known for its elastic properties similar to rubber. This material is already widely used because of its transparency biocompatibility and low-cost.</p><p>\"Our work establishes a reliable and robust yet low-cost technique for the fabrication of versatile 3-D structures in polydimethylsixolane\" Agad said.</p><p>Microfluidic devices can be used to trap and sort living organisms such as bacteria viruses and cells. With this new 3-D device that has a higher sensitivity and throughput than the two-dimensional version according to Agah he is able to make their predictions of applications ranging from water and food safety to fighting biological and chemical terrorism and to healthcare by fishing for abnormal cells in body fluids.</p><p>Both Hosseini of Kashan Iran and Zellner of Hampton Va. are working on their doctoral degrees. Zellner is a SMART scholarship recipient from the Department of Defense.</p><div><p>The College of Engineering at Virginia Tech is internationally recognized for its excellence in 14 engineering disciplines and computer science. The college's 6000 undergraduates benefit from an innovative curriculum that provides a \"hands-on minds-on\" approach to engineering education complementing classroom instruction with two unique design-and-build facilities and a strong Cooperative Education Program.

A 1977 graduate of Martinsville High School McCready entered Danville Community College (DCC) and spent two years and two summers earning his first associate degree in general electronics with a magna *** laude designation.</p><p>He graduated from DCC on a Saturday in August 1979 left for Norfolk the following day and on Monday started classes at ODU. He spent the academic year of 1979-80 there but found that he needed a lot of general education classes to earn a degree from ODU.

Two weeks after he enrolled in Radford he started taking business management classes at nearby New River Community College.

Then that fall he re-entered ODU taking with him the general education credits he had earned at Radford.</p><p>Consistent with his well-honed work ethic of being a full-time student simultaneously at two colleges the previous year he found extra ways of spending his time efficiently back at ODU. While taking a full load of classes for his electrical engineering technology degree there he taught a lab class in electrical motors as an undergraduate and picked up evening classes at Thomas Nelson and Tidewater (Virginia Beach campus) Community Colleges toward his business degree at New River.</p><p>In late May 1982 he graduated *** laude from ODU; a couple of weeks later he graduated *** laude from New River with an associate degree in business management. That’s three degrees in five years.</p><p>His first job after graduating from ODU was as a plant engineer for Union Camp a paper mill in Franklin Va.  After two and one half years there he became the company’s youngest superintendent of maintenance.

He says “The bottom line for me is when I hear someone tell me that they do not have enough time for homework and work. I remind them that there are seven days to a week and 24 hours to a day. You must make a commitment to study and do your homework every day to keep your grades up.

Ray suffers from alopecia or baldness which started as alopecia areata in which he lost quarter-sized patches of hair; it progressed to alopecia totalis which means his entire head was devoid of hair.</p><p>Most people with totalis lose even their eyebrows and eyelashes but Harding notes that Ray’s grew back. Some can even develop alopecia universalis which means they lose all hair on every part of their body.</p><p>“He was three years old” says Harding of the onset. “As soon as we started noticing the spots we took Ray [to the doctor] and he was diagnosed then with alopecia areata. Then they suggested that we go to a dermatologist. And we did and at that time even now there’s just no cure for it so there was nothing we could do.”</p><p>She continues “When I first took Ray to the doctor it’s all kinds of things that can affect it. It could be in the genes. We don’t have it running in our genes that I know of. I’ve heard that it could be an environmental issue. It could be something in the air. But as far as I know they have no cure for it and really they don’t have a clue of exactly what causes it. It’s just something in the immune system that triggers that part of the hair follicle that will cause it to happen. And anywhere from 1 to 2 percent of the population in the United States have it.”</p><p>Alopecia is defined as an autoimmune disease; hair loss and wavy pitted brittle nails are its main symptoms. “It’s different for every person” says Harding of the stages and severity of the disease. It is not fatal or even painful—unless you take into account the social toll it can take on its younger victims.</p><p>“I remember it started in preschool” Harding recalls. “He came home one day and he was looking out the door and my sister asked him ‘Ray what’s wrong? Is there something wrong?’ He’s like ‘I’m just praying.’ She’s like ‘Well what are you praying about?’ He’s like ‘I’m praying God will give me hair.’ And she’s like ‘Well why are you praying for that?’ and he’s like ‘Well because the kids at school sing a song.’ And she’s like ‘What’s the song about?’ [sings] ‘Ray ain’t got no hair he ain’t got no hair.’ Stuff like that.”</p><p>The bullying continued throughout Ray’s grade school years. “I remember in second grade coming to eat lunch with him and the older kids like in fourth or fifth grade would walk by and they were smacking his hat off. He’s always dealt with things like that but now that he’s gotten older of course his skin’s gotten a lot thicker he deals with a lot better” Harding says.</p><p>“I remember third grade because you know you always get stares and the first question that people will ask is ‘Does he have cancer?’ Because nobody knows about alopecia. And that’s what was bad.” Harding would have to take time and explain “‘No it’s this autoimmune disease that causes your hair to fall out.’”</p><p>For a long time Harding fell back on her religious faith to get her and her son through a trying time. “We just put our trust in God” she says.  “God was our support the whole time. But that was OK.” There were no local support groups before but Harding and Ray want to change that.</p><p>“Our goal is now to help out other kids that have alopecia. For instance there’s two girls that live in Carroll County that’s the same age as Ray that have it. One of the girls she has universalis she has no eyebrows or eyelashes” says Harding. “So Ray and I decided with this little girl’s mother to start a support group because you know girls it’s harder on them. And Ray’s been real good he’s a real humble child he reaches out to kids that have other problems.”</p><p>Harding feels that a support group however small will be a big help to any area kids with alopecia. “Now Ray’s not depressed and he doesn’t have a low self-esteem but there’s been times when he said ‘I wish I had hair’” she says. “But I know it’s worse on these girls. I guess that was just my thing where the suicides are so bad where kids are being bullied for a variety of reasons. All we wanted to do is as a community as a church reach out raise awareness of how something as simple as not having an eyebrow we’re judged on it and picked on.”</p><p>The religious institution is River of Life Pentecostal Church in Dublin which Harding and Ray attend and where the support group will have its first meeting.  “I just talked to Mike [Honaker River of Life’s pastor] about doing one but as far as the Church goes they’ve been great” she says.</p><p>“They don’t look at Ray any differently. I’m sure there’s probably some in the church wonders what it is but we haven’t addressed it yet. There needs to be an awareness out there and we want to reach out to other kids that have low self-esteem and help them out” she said.</p><p>Harding restates her concern about how alopecia and the teasing and bullying it sometimes draws can lead kids to doubt their own worth. She has been especially worried for kids ever since hearing about a youth in Tennessee with alopecia who ended up committing suicide.</p><p>“We just want to do what we can to build their self-esteem and give them confidence and let them know you know we’re here for them. God made them in His image in his likeness” Harding says.  “And our main goal too is to reach out to kids and tell them that men might judge your appearance on the outside but God looks on the inside.”</p><p>“And I mean you know my thing is we’ve always lived in a world where people are judged by their color by their height weight and you know it even comes down to something simple as hair” she says. “That’s just the life we live in. And we not only want to reach out to kids with alopecia we want to reach out to any of the kids that have low self-esteem. We want to bring that positive attitude and bring Christ into it. That’s the main goal just to reach out to kids and bring alopecia awareness.”</p><p>As for the alopecia awareness group “Anybody can come out. All we’re doing is getting the kids to meet each other and just talk. You know how do we want to do this? What’s everybody’s goal? And go from there. Anybody that would like to help with the support group that would be great.”</p><p>She also mentions a camp for kids with alopecia which Ray is going to in August. The camp is part of the Children’s Alopecia Project which is a nonprofit group dedicated to helping kids with alopecia.</p><p>Harding looks forward to having the kids meet up for the first time but her feelings for children who are different remain as sensitive as ever. “Every time I go somewhere and I see kids with disability or special needs my heart just breaks. And I want to be able to reach out to any of them.”</p><p>The first meeting of Harding’s alopecia support group will take place at the River of Life Pentecostal Church at 5311 Black Hollow Road in Dublin on July 13 at 6 p.m.</p><p>For more information about childhood alopecia or to make a donation visit  HYPERLINK “http://www.childrensalopeciaproject.com” www.childrensalopeciaproject.com.</p><p> </p><p> </p> </div></div>' LIMIT 1

And Ray’s been real good he’s a real humble child he reaches out to kids that have other problems.”</p><p>Harding feels that a support group however small will be a big help to any area kids with alopecia. “Now Ray’s not depressed and he doesn’t have a low self-esteem but there’s been times when he said ‘I wish I had hair’” she says. “But I know it’s worse on these girls. I guess that was just my thing where the suicides are so bad where kids are being bullied for a variety of reasons. All we wanted to do is as a community as a church reach out raise awareness of how something as simple as not having an eyebrow we’re judged on it and picked on.”</p><p>The religious institution is River of Life Pentecostal Church in Dublin which Harding and Ray attend and where the support group will have its first meeting.  “I just talked to Mike [Honaker River of Life’s pastor] about doing one but as far as the Church goes they’ve been great” she says.</p><p>“They don’t look at Ray any differently. I’m sure there’s probably some in the church wonders what it is but we haven’t addressed it yet. There needs to be an awareness out there and we want to reach out to other kids that have low self-esteem and help them out” she said.</p><p>Harding restates her concern about how alopecia and the teasing and bullying it sometimes draws can lead kids to doubt their own worth. She has been especially worried for kids ever since hearing about a youth in Tennessee with alopecia who ended up committing suicide.</p><p>“We just want to do what we can to build their self-esteem and give them confidence and let them know you know we’re here for them. God made them in His image in his likeness” Harding says.  “And our main goal too is to reach out to kids and tell them that men might judge your appearance on the outside but God looks on the inside.”</p><p>“And I mean you know my thing is we’ve always lived in a world where people are judged by their color by their height weight and you know it even comes down to something simple as hair” she says. “That’s just the life we live in. And we not only want to reach out to kids with alopecia we want to reach out to any of the kids that have low self-esteem. We want to bring that positive attitude and bring Christ into it. That’s the main goal just to reach out to kids and bring alopecia awareness.”</p><p>As for the alopecia awareness group “Anybody can come out. All we’re doing is getting the kids to meet each other and just talk. You know how do we want to do this? What’s everybody’s goal? And go from there. Anybody that would like to help with the support group that would be great.”</p><p>She also mentions a camp for kids with alopecia which Ray is going to in August. The camp is part of the Children’s Alopecia Project which is a nonprofit group dedicated to helping kids with alopecia.</p><p>Harding looks forward to having the kids meet up for the first time but her feelings for children who are different remain as sensitive as ever. “Every time I go somewhere and I see kids with disability or special needs my heart just breaks. And I want to be able to reach out to any of them.”</p><p>The first meeting of Harding’s alopecia support group will take place at the River of Life Pentecostal Church at 5311 Black Hollow Road in Dublin on July 13 at 6 p.m.</p><p>For more information about childhood alopecia or to make a donation visit  HYPERLINK “http://www.childrensalopeciaproject.com” www.childrensalopeciaproject.com.</p><p> </p><p> </p>   </div></div>"], ["external_popularity", 0], ["fb_comments_count", 0], ["fb_id", nil], ["fb_likes_count", 0], ["fb_link", nil], ["fb_type", nil], ["image_content_type", nil], ["image_file_name", nil], ["image_file_size", nil], ["image_updated_at", nil], ["image_url", nil], ["kind", 2], ["latitude", 41.7106948], ["longitude", -71.1349712], ["popularity", 0], ["published_at", Mon, 01 Jul 2013 15:21:35 UTC +00:00], ["related_story_id", nil], ["source", "The Southwest Times"], ["source_url", "http://www.southwesttimes.com/2013/07/local-mom-starts-support-group-for-childhood-alopecia/"], ["title", "Local mom starts support group for childhood alopecia"], ["topic_id", 20], ["tweets_count", 0], ["twitter_id", nil], ["twitter_retweet_count", 0], ["updated_at", Wed, 03 Jul 2013 06:08:08 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["user_id", nil], ["views", 0]]

He was 16 years old at the time and sustained serious damage to the frontal lobes of his brain according to Duncan’s attorney Ari Casper.</p><p>A mistrial was declared in the case last year when a jury was unable to reach a decision following three weeks of testimony.

Governor McDonnell signed HB2084/SB1175: The Teach for America Act (Cox/Ruff) SB1324: Opportunity Educational Institution (McDougle) and HB1999/SB1207: A-F School Grading (Greason/Stanley).</p> <p>Speaking today about the bill signings Governor McDonnell remarked “The legislation signed into law today establishes Virginia’s position as a national leader in innovative education reform. HB2084 and SB1175 will allow divisions in northern southwest and central Virginia the opportunity to partner with Teach for America as an additional source for high-quality and diverse educators trained and supported to teach in our schools with the greatest needs. Since 1990 corps members have impacted the lives of more than 3 million children in low-income communities across the country. Teach For America has trained more teachers for low-income communities than any other organization or institution in the nation. Today we are honored to welcome Teach For America to the Commonwealth.</p><p>“Because we believe that all children deserve access to an excellent education the Opportunity Educational Institution (OEI) will also become law today. In the year ahead the OEI will begin to develop relationships with school and community leaders in anticipation of eligible schools transferring to the institution in the fall of 2014. Today I am pleased to announce that we will begin recruiting for the institution’s executive director. The OEI will transform our approach to failing schools.</p><p>“A-F school grading will allow parents to clearly understand how their local school is actually performing. A-F school grading will be a catalyst for parents and community leaders to get more involved in the success of their schools. I applaud the leadership of Delegate Greason Senator Stanley and the General Assembly in making A-F school grading available to all parents and community members.”</p><p>Delegate Kirk Cox former public school teacher and ALL STUDENTS co-chair commented “The ALL STUDENTS agenda passed with broad bi-partisan support during the 2013 General Assembly session. The Teach for America Act Opportunity Educational Institution and A-F School Grading will ensure that regardless of ZIP code Virginia’s children are provided an excellent education. I applaud Governor McDonnell and my colleagues in the General Assembly for their leadership.”</p><p>Former Virginia Secretary of Education Jim Dyke said “It is time for Virginia''s business education and community leaders to drive the reform effort and enhance the global competitiveness of our future workforce. It is simply not enough for Virginia to be ranked 4th in a nation that is at the bottom of international rankings. As Will Rogers said being on the right track is not enough. If you''re not moving forward aggressively you''ll still get run over. I applaud Governor McDonnell and the bipartisan cooperation in the General Assembly for taking action. If we build on and continue these reforms I am confident Virginia can lead the world in the quality and skills of our workforce.”</p><p>Eva Colen Teach for America’s Virginia Community Engagement Director adds that “As a native Virginian having led recruitment efforts for Teach For America in the Commonwealth for the last three years I’m thrilled and honored to begin conversations with community leaders school divisions and philanthropists across the state to explore the possibility of joining ongoing efforts to help ensure that all students in our state have access to an excellent education.</p><p>A description of the legislation ceremonially signed into law today is included below: </p> HB2084 (K. Cox) / SB1175 (Ruff): Teach for America Act. A significant achievement gap still exists between our students. While the task will not be easy TFA has been successful in working with schools to close the achievement gap. Teach for America recruits and trains the best and brightest recent college graduates from across the country to accept full-time teaching assignments in hard-to-staff schools. This legislation will allow for TFA to operate in Virginia and begin placing teachers in hard-to-staff schools starting in the 2013-2014 academic year. SB1324 (McDougle): Opportunity Educational Institution (OEI). The OEI will focus on turning around chronically failing public schools in the Commonwealth. Consistent with the Constitution of Virginia "it is desirable for the intellectual cultural and occupational development of the people of the Commonwealth . . . . to ensure that an educational program of high quality is established and continually maintained for all students throughout the Commonwealth" This law establishes a statewide Opportunity Educational Institution to provide a high quality education for children attending any failing public elementary or secondary school. The Opportunity Educational Institution will be uniquely positioned to turnaround failing schools and provide all students the opportunity they deserve. While this model is new to Virginia it is proven nationally. States like Louisiana and Tennessee have created Recovery and Achievement districts and the results are positive. HB1999 (Greason) / SB1207 (Stanley): A-F School Report Cards. Creates a pathway for the DOE to report individual school performance using an A-F grading system in addition to the standards of accreditation. The A-F report cards will make school performance clear and easily communicated to parents and the public. The new report cards will recognize schools for challenging all students to reach high levels of achievement. They will also give schools a tool to encourage more parental and community involvement. When parents and community members have a clear understanding of school performance all students benefit. <p>Governor McDonnell is hosting a K-12 Education Reform Summit on August 5th in Chantilly Virginia.

July 1 2013 – After notable careers in agriculture and higher education Jim and Janet Johnson of Roanoke Va. could have slipped quietly into a well-deserved retirement and simply filled their days with nothing more than long walks and sunsets.</p><p>Instead they took the opportunity to become full-time award-winning philanthropists.</p><p>The husband and wife were awarded the Ruby C. McSwain Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the National Agricultural Alumni Development Association at its annual conference on June 18 in Alexandria Va.</p><p>The award honors individuals who have demonstrated sustained giving to agricultural initiatives including agriculture in higher education extension or land-grant universities. The award also recognizes advocacy for agriculture and natural resource management in the form of philanthropic commitments.</p><p>The Johnson’s commitment to their community through giving and volunteer service has meant that retirement has been anything but quiet.</p><p>“Everybody flunks retirement occasionally” joked Jim Johnson of his and his wife’s fruitful post-career associations with numerous philanthropic endeavors at Virginia Tech and the surrounding communities in the New River Valley.</p><p>“I grew up a very involved farm boy and I guess it stayed with me. It never rubbed off. I was lucky enough to marry a spouse who had the same passion” said Jim Johnson.</p><p>He received degrees from Virginia Tech and North Carolina State University and spent his professional career as a Virginia Cooperative Extension agent at Virginia Tech ultimately retiring as Extension director and associate professor emeritus of Extension.</p><p>“For as long as I have known the Johnsons they have given their time talent and treasure to Virginia Tech and the community.

July 1 2013 – After notable careers in agriculture and higher education Jim and Janet Johnson of Roanoke Va. could have slipped quietly into a well-deserved retirement and simply filled their days with nothing more than long walks and sunsets.</p><p>Instead they took the opportunity to become full-time award-winning philanthropists.</p><p>The husband and wife were awarded the Ruby C. McSwain Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the National Agricultural Alumni Development Association at its annual conference on June 18 in Alexandria Va.</p><p>The award honors individuals who have demonstrated sustained giving to agricultural initiatives including agriculture in higher education extension or land-grant universities. The award also recognizes advocacy for agriculture and natural resource management in the form of philanthropic commitments.</p><p>The Johnson’s commitment to their community through giving and volunteer service has meant that retirement has been anything but quiet.</p><p>“Everybody flunks retirement occasionally” joked Jim Johnson of his and his wife’s fruitful post-career associations with numerous philanthropic endeavors at Virginia Tech and the surrounding communities in the New River Valley.</p><p>“I grew up a very involved farm boy and I guess it stayed with me. It never rubbed off. I was lucky enough to marry a spouse who had the same passion” said Jim Johnson.</p><p>He received degrees from Virginia Tech and North Carolina State University and spent his professional career as a Virginia Cooperative Extension agent at Virginia Tech ultimately retiring as Extension director and associate professor emeritus of Extension.</p><p>“For as long as I have known the Johnsons they have given their time talent and treasure to Virginia Tech and the community.

A spillway near the resort’s Newport Cottage will allow the lake to properly drain when at capacity — it drains down and feeds another natural state treasure — The Cascades waterfalls.</p><p>By Aaron Atkins</p> <p>Tags: aerial adventure course Giles County Mountain Lake Resort zip lines</p> <p>  This entry was posted on Tuesday July 2nd 2013 at 8:17 am and is filed under FEATURES News Messenger.

Chamber Board of Directors President Wally Galla said Monday the organization is excited to bring Linkous back to continue work on behalf of Radford’s business community.</p><p>Galla also said the Chamber board has met with the Main Street Radford board of directors to discuss the possibilities of combining office space and using other cost-saving measures to make both the Chamber and Main Street Radford more viable.</p><p>City Council has not appropriated Main Street Radford’s city funding for the upcoming fiscal year and Radford Mayor Dr. Bruce Brown said Monday council would not consider approving funding until the organization returns to council with an updated contract with the city that details deliverable services. At council’s June 10 meeting Brown and council members discussed that annual agreement between MSR and the city the document that details the accomplishments MSR must make in exchange for $51000 in city funds annually with MSR Board President Wanda Pearce and acting treasurer Mary Day.</p><p>“What’s missing from this is a list of deliverables” said Brown at the June 10 meeting.  “It’s short on details.”</p><p>Also at the June 10 meeting council member Keith Marshall said he questions whether or not the city is getting its money’s worth.</p><p>“We are committing $51000 in taxpayer money to this” said Marshall. “When I have to look someone in the eye and tell them their money’s been well-spent — can I say that? Is this money well-spent?”</p><p>At that meeting Pearce said she feels the organization needs to redirect its focus spending less time on events and more time on filling vacant storefronts and fostering the rehabilitation of historic buildings. Since that time Pearce has resigned from the board according to remaining MSR board members. Board members also say Main Street Radford Director Becky Haupt will be laid off June 30 when the current fiscal year funding runs out.</p><p>MSR also cancelled the June installment of the Radford After Five concert series. In information released June 19 MSR cites an evolving focus as reason for the concert cancellation.</p><p>“As the needs of the City of Radford continue to evolve the Main Street Radford Board of Directors are reviewing and recalibrating our promotion and economic development efforts to better serve the community” the statement reads. “Main Street Radford apologizes for any inconvenience this change may cause.</p><p>“It remains a major goal of Main Street Radford to present strong community events and this would not be possible without the tremendous support and the Board thanks the community for their continued support” it continues.</p><p>By Heather Bell</p> <p>Tags: Main Street Radford Mayor Dr. Bruce Brown Radford Chamber of Commerce</p> <p> This entry was posted on Tuesday July 2nd 2013 at 7:14 am and is filed under Radford News Journal.

Chamber Board of Directors President Wally Galla said Monday the organization is excited to bring Linkous back to continue work on behalf of Radford’s business community.</p><p>Galla also said the Chamber board has met with the Main Street Radford board of directors to discuss the possibilities of combining office space and using other cost-saving measures to make both the Chamber and Main Street Radford more viable.</p><p>City Council has not appropriated Main Street Radford’s city funding for the upcoming fiscal year and Radford Mayor Dr. Bruce Brown said Monday council would not consider approving funding until the organization returns to council with an updated contract with the city that details deliverable services. At council’s June 10 meeting Brown and council members discussed that annual agreement between MSR and the city the document that details the accomplishments MSR must make in exchange for $51000 in city funds annually with MSR Board President Wanda Pearce and acting treasurer Mary Day.</p><p>“What’s missing from this is a list of deliverables” said Brown at the June 10 meeting.  “It’s short on details.”</p><p>Also at the June 10 meeting council member Keith Marshall said he questions whether or not the city is getting its money’s worth.</p><p>“We are committing $51000 in taxpayer money to this” said Marshall. “When I have to look someone in the eye and tell them their money’s been well-spent — can I say that? Is this money well-spent?”</p><p>At that meeting Pearce said she feels the organization needs to redirect its focus spending less time on events and more time on filling vacant storefronts and fostering the rehabilitation of historic buildings. Since that time Pearce has resigned from the board according to remaining MSR board members. Board members also say Main Street Radford Director Becky Haupt will be laid off June 30 when the current fiscal year funding runs out.</p><p>MSR also cancelled the June installment of the Radford After Five concert series. In information released June 19 MSR cites an evolving focus as reason for the concert cancellation.</p><p>“As the needs of the City of Radford continue to evolve the Main Street Radford Board of Directors are reviewing and recalibrating our promotion and economic development efforts to better serve the community” the statement reads. “Main Street Radford apologizes for any inconvenience this change may cause.</p><p>“It remains a major goal of Main Street Radford to present strong community events and this would not be possible without the tremendous support and the Board thanks the community for their continued support” it continues.</p><p>By Heather Bell</p> <p>Tags: Main Street Radford Mayor Dr. Bruce Brown Radford Chamber of Commerce</p> <p>  This entry was posted on Tuesday July 2nd 2013 at 7:14 am and is filed under Radford News Journal.
